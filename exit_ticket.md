# Exit Ticket
Most importantly, I have a much broader idea of what digital history can entail, concretely. I’ve seen and used more methods than I could have guessed were used by digital historians at the beginning of the course (*Digital history? So like a website? With…text? And images? Yes that sounds like the extent of it!*). The ways of analyzing and displaying data that we’ve seen were often not tools I imagined could be used with history, but now I can easily imagine how things like networks or sound could offer new perspectives. 

Previously, when I thought about doing history, I would picture someone bent over individual documents from an archive, reading each one individually for hours and trying to draw a conclusion. Obviously this is still something that’s done, but I can now see that digital history tools make it possible to analyze much more data than one human could consume and interpret. The big data approaches we saw, such as network analysis and corpus analysis, can reveal trends or abnormalities in an instant that a person might never notice or be able to see. Learning about MALLET was something that really drove this home for [me](https://hyp.is/0fg5GJMeEeq-lAu2LHZGJg/www.cameronblevins.org/posts/topic-modeling-martha-ballards-diary/). I was able to use some of these technologies (Voyant and Antconc) this week to look at historical sources I gathered.

At the same time, I’ve become aware of the possible drawbacks to technology, such as how it can shape our questions for the sake of using that technology or let our prior knowledge influence our interpretations of data (as I mentioned [here](https://kieranheffernan.github.io/week-4/journal)). I can definitely see myself as someone who would get overexcited and want to use tech for the sake of using tech, but the reading from week 4 definitely made me think about the motivations behind asking certain questions. 

I received a lot of help from the Discord, both from asking my own questions and reading about other people’s problems and solutions. I tried to help others when I could as well.

I think what I struggled most with was crafting actual arguments with what I found. I felt like this a lot of the time:

It was easy to think, “well that seems interesting” but I wasn’t always sure how to go beyond that. I did try to go deeper with some of my arguments [this week]( https://kieranheffernan.github.io/Grace-and-Lace/intro).

I think I was professional in my interactions with others and in the work I’ve created.

None of my failures were particularly glorious; moreso they were little infuriating failures (often with coding) that I couldn’t figure out myself. But I am grateful for the lack of catastrophes or downloading of the entire internet. 

I think some aspects that I could see myself using in the future are wget and OCR, because those processes I understand well enough to apply to situations that aren’t exactly the same as the ones from the weekly exercises. I already used REGEX in my daily life! I was making a list of songs, but I realized I didn’t want to keep writing the artists beside the name each time (e.g. Yesterday *by The Beatles*) so I was able to delete everything following and including the word “by”.

I would put my mark at around A-. I think I achieved most of the learning outcomes, as described above, but like I said I struggled with the argumentation.
