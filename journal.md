In coming across the Grace and Lace database, of course I was initially filled with plenty of questions. How can evangelical Christianity and trans people/crossdressers possibly go together? How can these people still want to be Christian? Are they accepted in their church communities?

I think I found some preliminary ideas relating to some of these questions, as well as came up with some areas I'd like to look into more. It seems like a lot of people actually find comfort in believing in God, and knowing that he has a plan for them and being trans is part of that. So being a crossdresser or trans actually can fit well into Christianity, from that perspective. 

Some directions I could see further research taking is how trans people/crossdressers were treated and responded to other members of their churches. I would also look into how references to the devil/satan/etc. are used. 

The sources were indeed messy. Although the pdfs already had the text overlayed on them (so I didn't have to do the OCR myself) there were a lot of errors. I originally wanted to do topic modelling as well, but there were so many errors in the texts that the topics were full of nonsense words and I couldn't figure out anything from them. If there was a way to clean up the data a bit more, I would be interested in what topic modelling could reveal.

As I was exploring Voyant and Antconc, I had to remind myself not to get dissapointed that I didn't feel like I was "discovering" anything. Not only was this only the very first step one would take with researching, but something that a prof once said in an email to my friend came to mind:

"I think of humanities scholarship as more of a process of "creative tinkering." At the end of a period of intense engagement with archival sources I am inclined to ask myself: "now, what can I make of this (that people will want to read)?" ...to me it seems that this model of "research" is really more a form of finding material to support a story you've already settled on -- journalism rather than scholarship!"

So I am trying to be happy with my "creative tinkering"!

I think Michelle Moravec and I took similar approaches to zooming in and out from our information. We both observed things that were not surprising based on what we already knew (artists dominating Schneemann's correspondents, trans church members avoiding other church members). She also inspired me to search for collocates with "the" to find interesting patterns. Although maybe I should have taken more time to look closer at the primary sources, as she did. I got a bit carried away only looking at a bigger picture using the tools, without paying much attention to reading whole sections of the texts, i.e. zooming in.
