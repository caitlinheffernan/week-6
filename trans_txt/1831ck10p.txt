WHERE ARE YOU GOD?
by
JR

H
Dare we ask an impertinant question? Dare we a sk, "Where are you, God? Dare we be so bold? Yes! We dare. We

are hu man. We have ve ry little conceptualization as to what God is, who God is, and especially where God is. All of us
have notions. All of us have read the scripture, so me more than others, some wi th

intellect

alone and others with an

open heart and a sub missive spirit. Still, few of us, if any, really can answer the questions we are a ski ng.
We get lost in mundane issues. We get lost in worrying about minutia. We get lost worrying about what is a sin and
what i s not a sin. We forget the huge pri nciples such as: "for all have sinned and come short of the Glory of God!" We
get so wrapped up in things which really don't matter we forge t such wonderful tru ths as Jesus's

statemen t :

"I am the

way, the Truth and the Ught. No one comes to th! Fa�her but b_y Me!" \_'V� ��c?.me so focused on our own insignifican t
:
fretting and the temptations of th e evil one who
the law and oJr natural fear of the law to lure our eyes off of Jesu s

u�

Christ and onto ourselves. Clearly, for the believer, the most powerful doubt instilling weapon there is for use by the
enemy

is our human failure to understand the teachings of the very book we hold the dearest:

th e

Bible.

No human knows the Bible so well as does t he enemy. No human quotes saipture with greater fluency than does th e
enemy.

No human is so ad�pt at provin g his point of v iew by proof texts as is the enemy. Knowing our reve rence for

God's word and knowing also our faulty limited comprehension of it, the enemy simply uses it against us almost at will.
His most common temptat ion is to challenge our faith in Jesus Chri st by pounding us over the head with law to induce
guilt whi ch itself

is

the very opposite of faith. The

more intellectually

steepe d we are in the very word of God, t he

more we are prone to be ing attacked with that which we know and love the most.
How do we survive the assaults of the evil one who would deny us the joy of our salvation by inducing guilt in us
through his deliberate misuse of God' s own Word? The answer to this demanding question is not easy for us humans. We
are accustomed to living by our wits and benefitting from our superior

intellectual

powers. What we do not realize is

that our superior inte llectual powers are superior perhaps to the remainder of life on the earth, but they are decidedly
INFERIOR to the intelle ctual powe rs of our enemy. He merely toys with us, the brightest

and

most powerfully minded

of us, leading us down one contorted path after another always holding out to us the promise of an intelligent solution to
spiritual questions being just around the next bend in the path. Of course, it is never there, but suckers we are because of
our stupendous pride in human

m ental

powe rs we keep playing the game. This

is

Nor a plea ag ainst reading and

studying the Word. Rather it is a call to read �d to study th e Bible praying constantly for the · enlig htnment of t he
Holy Spirit rather than seeking con stantly to comprehend the Word with the mind.
We can deal with the blandis hments of the enemy in but one way. As we realize our human cap acity to
spiritual

things by _intellect is terribly f aulty, we tum in a simple childlike fai th to Jesus Chri st who

is

h andle

our one hope.

As we become more and more doggedly insistant upon trusting Jesus in spite of all the seemingly log ical reasons we ought
to be trusting our intellectual grasp of the

matter,

we fin d the efforts of the

enemy

becoming more and more futile . We

know, because Jesus has promised it to us, we cannot be forcefully taken out of the hand of the Lord, but at the same time
what we perhaps don't realize is our witness can be neutralized by the enemy turning our attention away from th e Lord.

Remember what happened to impeteous Peter when Jes us came walking on the water
as the Deciples were be.
tossed about in their little boat by rough seas. Peter called out to Jesus who was approaching and said: "Lord
if it is you,
then command me to come to you." In essence, Jesus told him to come on. Peter without a second thought h
opped out of the

boat in the middle of the sea and started walking on the water toward Jesus. Then it evid en tly occured to him just
what
he was_ doing and his human intellect instantly told him this was impossible. He evidently looked down taking
his
eyes off of Jesus and began to sink. This is what happens to us each time we become so wrapped up in worries about the

Jaw we take our eyes off of the Lord and begin to sink into doubt and guilt. This allows the enemy to challenge our faith.
There are those of us who come from traditions in which virtuaJJy our entire religious experience has b een involved

in the "HeJJ fire and brimstone" approach to Christianity in which various teachers and preachers have literally

tried to scare Hell out of us. This is so sad. It is sad because it is clearly not Jesus' way. Let's look at the Lord, not at

details and fret about the law. What, for example, did Jesus do hanging on the cross when one of the two thieves

reviled him. Did Jesus quote law at him trying to convC!rt him thro1,Jgh the threats of punishment under the law? No, he

didn't. What did Jesus do when the other theif begged for forgiveness? Jesus freely gave it! Was there any

consideration taken in respect to all the laws this individual had broken? No. The laws and their having been broken

were of no importance to the Lord. What was vital to Jesus at .the moment was the turning of the individual to Him in
faith. This then is the one appropriate model for all of us in every instance. Turn to Jesus in faith believing in your

heart your salvation is secu� in Him. Do this and the promise Jesus made to the thief on the cross is yours as well:
"This day you shall be with me in Paradise!"

Clearly, it is as Martin Luther said: "Sola Gratia!" It is only through the Grace of God faith is planted by God in our

hearts, then God nurtures it and develops it, so that through this faith we might be returned to the special

relationship with God for which God created us in the first place. Remember, the holy word itself teaches us we are

saved through Faith and not through works so that no man (person) can boast! It is all God's doing. We are but the

recipiants of the Grace of God poured out on us even though we deserve anything but this outrageously generous and

wonderful gift.

Dare we ask the questions with which we began? Yes, indeed we dare ask. Unless we ask we cannot know, can we?

Clearly God does w.mt us to know where He is and what our relationship with him is to be. Perhaps we have to ask

first with our intellect so we can come face to face with our incapacity to know God intellectually. Clearly, once we

have come to this knowledge we are ready for God to begin to work FAITH in us. It is with faith we are finally able to
comprehend what we need to know of God, where God is (inside the believer) and what our relationship with God is.

Jesus Christ has called you to salvation because He loves you JUST AS YOU ARE! If there are any changes, and there

probably are, (most probably not the ones you think too!) the �rd wishes to make in perfecting you, then leave it to the

power of the Holy Spirit to effect those changes. You are beloved, JUSf AS YOU ARE! Rest in this faith and you will
know real JOY!

STRENGTH THROUGH WEAKNESS
by Rebecca Allison
"If my life ts broken when gtven to

multitude. while a loaf will satisfy only a
Uttle lad."
Women's Devotional Bible
Page 1084
In a small Southern state capital.
society seems to automatically bestow
status according to profession. Bankers
and attorneys. business executives and
architects.. :and. of course. physicians.
While others struggle for years to ew n
the respect of their colleagues. the
physician has immediate respect on
beginning a practice. Who you are ls
defined by what you do.
Once. not too long ago. I had this
respect. But it has quickly disappeared.
For I have clearty become "not one of
the group". I don't flt the mold any­
more.
The word has been spread. I dont
know who started it: it doesn't matter.
All my colleagues have heard I am
"having a sex change." I am having to
discuss it with friends and acquain­
tances much more often...that ls. the
ones who are willing to listen.
Some persons handle my disclo­
sures by simply withdrawing. They no
longer stop me in the hallway to talk:
they avoid my table at lunch. Without
openly rejecting me. they have silently
done so. I am learning to deal with thl8
rejection. Those who have known the
person I appeared to be In the past have
the rtght to disassociate from the person
they see me becoming.
Still I find it a new and humbling .
experience. In many areas of my Ufe.
such as scholastic achievements and
professional skills. I have become ac­
customed to success In the traditional
sense, as the world defines It.
But while I was enjoying the exter­
nal success. I experienced constant In-

ner turmoil knowtng the real and gentle
person within was unable to ftnd re­
lease: unable to experience life as...
herself.
What now? All has turned upside
down. Perhaps later. some external
success will return to mv new Ufe: but lt
ls certainly vanishing now. And yet my
Inner life ls becoming orderly and
peaceful: My Lord. through ms holy ·
spirit. ls brtnglng me peace through the
rough months oftransition.
God does not vtcw success as men
do. Throughout the Bible we are re­
minded that He looks at our hearts
rather than our degrees. neighborhoods.
or bank accounts.
Accounts of victory In the face of re­
jection abound in Scripture. Consider
the personal and family losses sus­
tained by Job: the scorn and rejection of
Hosea by his wife: and the Imprison­
ment of Jeremiah. King David experi ­
enced rejection from his wife Michal.
When the Ark of the Covenant was re­
turned to Jerusalem, David led the pa­
rade with dancing and shouting. Hts
wife considered this unbecoming for a
man of his position. and she "despised
him In her heart". [2 Samuel 6: 16)
Paul gave up a career full of great
promise as a Phartsce in order to hum­
ble himself before Jesus. He endured
prison, beatings. stonings. ridicule.
physical lnflrmlty. and ultimately exe­
cution. He prayed for deliverance from
his dlfftcultles: and the Lord responded
In this way: "My grace ts sufficient for
you. for my power ls made perfect In
weakness." Paul concluded. "That ls
why. for Christ's sake. I dellght ln
weaknesses, In insults. tn hardships. ln
persecutlons, In dlfflculttes. For when I
am weak. then I am strong." 12
Corinthians 12:9- IOJ
Jesus experienced rejection so much
more profound than I will ever know.
He associated hlmsclf With sinners and

common people. declining the status
with the Jewtsh community which could
have been His. His brilliant teachin g
cou ld have established Him. in time. as
a leading rabbi. Imagine the Jews say­
i ng . " How could he throw away such a
promising career?"
B u t He chos_e to live ln harmony
with His nature : to love and minister to
all persons. The poo r. outcasts . lepers.

was sinful to vtstt and sit down to eat
with "sinners " . But He replied, "It Is not
the healthy who need a doctor. but the
sick. " ( Matthew 9: 1 2 1
My Lord has allowed me to ex pe ri­
ence the rejection of men. My intellect
and my skills will not be enough to sus ­
tain me through the next few months
and years. I know now. I must depend
on Him for all things . On ly He ts con ­
stant in his love. Only He will never let
me down. I c� go to Hlm with humility
now. I have hurts and deep wounds: so
does He. A!J the song says,
And Jesus said, "Come to the water:
stand by my side.

I know you are thirsty. You won't be
denied.
I felt every teardrop. when tn dark­
ness you crl.ed.
And I strove to remind you, that fo r
those tears I dled. "
His blood . . . HJs agony and death . . .
and Hts glorious triumph over It all are
more real to me now than they have
ever been. And my willingness to share
what He has done for me ls greater than
ever. I finally have a testimony. In the
past I felt vag u e ly u n comforta ble
around pe rsons who said. "The Lord got
me throu g h such a trial. " because I
cou ldn't relate to them. I had had no
such trials of my own . But now I have.
And He ls more than able to sustain me .
In my new found weakness I can fi­
nally feel His strength.
And there will come a time when I
am strengthened enough to minister to
those who have hurt as I have . One
who has expe rienced the same rejection
can be a source of strength and sup­
port. If I can know I helped one other
soul navtgatc this course. it will all be
worthwhile.

EASTER CHICKEN
by Kathy Swttzet 13. \).
Have you not trP,d how people treat
each other? The way they talk about
others when they aren't arou nd? You
wonder abou t It all. especially when all
this is going or, In the church.
Reminds me of a time when I was a
little girl growt ng u p in I ndiana. We
tlved in a small town called J asonville.
J ust ou tside of Terre Haute. My Mom
taught school there and my Dad worked
at the university. I was about five years
old and my sister was four.
There was a man there ·by the name
. of Roebuck. Now Mr. Roebuck was what
you wou ld call the town dru n k . This
man took a liking to my sister and me.
and he was friendly to my dad who on
Satu rdays would be working in the
garage behind the house. Mr. Roebuck
wou ld come to the back yard fence to
talk to us girls, then he wou ld go to the
garage and talk to Dad for awhile.
Mr. Roe buck would bring some
candy or little_-toys for us children to
play with . We really looked forward to
seeing him come arou nd on Saturdays
for his visits.
One year. the holidays of Easter and
Passover fell on the same weekend. Mr.
Roe buck came to ou r house and pre­
sented my sister and me two of the
prettiest chicks you ever saw. They were
all fuzzy ye llow: you cou ld J ust hear
then "cheepi ng" along. They were to be
our very own Easter Chicke ns. Jean's
c hick met a very u nhappy end , thanks
to the local cat: but mine grew and was
very healthy.
We kept that c hick ln a box on the
back porch. He would scratch and peck
and do all t he things chickens normally
do. But as he grew. he grew pin feathers
and the fuzzy down disappeared. That
was one ugly chicken!
One day my Dad said, "that ct:itcken
has to go. " 1 guess it was because the
bird got on the clothesline, and you can

- ,o -

g uess what he d id. My u ncle C harlie
had a farm . just north of us in Attica.
We took the chicken up to the farm one
Sunday. We went to the barnyard where
U ncle C harlie kept his farm animals
and chickens. We tu rned ou r chicken
loose and he went over to t he other
chickens as t hey were feeding. B u t the
other birds wouldn't let him eat. In fact
they were downright mean to him. They
pecked and kicked so that I was afraid
to let him stay there.
But we left the chicken there; and
when
came back to the same barn­
yani ' later in the year. I cou ldn't believe
what 1 saw. ' The ugly little chic ken grew
up to be a big old white Leghorn rooster.
You could see him strutting arou nd the
barnyard like he owned the place.
But what surprised me about that
bird was the way he went about treating
the other birds. He treated them the
same way they treated him when he was
a little thi ng. He would go arou nd
pecking and kicking them as if they had
done something to him.
That chicken was gtven to me some
thirty-two years ago. and to this day
when I think about it, that chicken re­
minds me so much of the people who
are arou nd me . We who follow t he
teachings of Jesus Christ are to live in
such a way that people can know that .
yes. we are different. That we d o take
very seriously. "in everything do to oth­
ers as you would have them do to you . "
and "love your neighbor as yourself."
But it seems to me that there are
lots of these Easter chickens running ln
the henhouse called the church. by just
looking at the way the people look and
act toward someone who ls different or
not a part of that group. The Love of
C h rist Is nowhere to be found. So we
have a choice to make, my friends; we
can be Easter chickens or we can love
others as Jesus did.

Our
Greatest Need
If our greatest need
had been information,
God would have sent us an educator.

If our greatest need

had been technology,
God would have sent us a scientist.

If our greatest need

had been money,
God would have sent us an economist.

If our greatest need

had been pleasure,
God would have sent us an entertainer.
But our greatest need
was forgiveness,
So God sent us a Savior.

God
Incarnate
God came to earth that Holy Night
In the Fann ofa Baby 13oy,
That all might come to knaw Him,
His Ioue, His peace, His joy.
Came to hang upon the Cross,
The Cross of Calvary,
That all who so believe might live
With Him, throughout Eternity.
Great is our God and wonderful,
That, through our Savior Jesus Christ,
That Baby born in Bethlehem,
Souls might have eternal life.
Glorify Him-praise His Name,
Surrender your whole life unto Him,
And in His Holy Spirit,
God; in Christ, will dwell within.
-Ruth V. F.aker

LETIERS
I have felt a little guilty about being a CD. These [G&LL; .1ewslf'tte1 s han� h�lped m('
to understand that I should not be ashamed of it. -- TN
I think a lot of people simply go by their own prejudices and then go through the
Bible · 1ooking for passages that s upport what they already thin k. They also find
passages they can twist in favor of those prej udices. They should let the Bible , and the
Christ it tells of. form their thinking. -- J .A. . Ml

Thank you for the G&LL sample. The article "Why me. Lord" was particularly spectal
to me . I ftnd the day to day grtnd. while trytng to ftnd my true life with God. to be
exhausting sometimes. It's good to read the reassurtng words of G&LL. -- OH
I'm glad I met Rcbecca . . . Thanks for sending G&LL. I usually go to church every
Sunday. I picked up your letter at the PO Box on Sunday: very fttttng! I am hopeful that
the publication will help give me the strength I need to deal with my situation. -- KS
Please continue the great work of G&LL and continue to keep me on your mailing
11st. Thank you very much for all of your help! G&LL has answered many questions and
some of my prayers. May the peace of Christ be with you always. - - MD
Thanks so much for the recent G&LL. It's comforting to know that there arc other
CD Chrtsttans out there. Please thank Becky and Jaye for me. I read their essays with
Interest and have already begun to contemplate the Issues they raised. Your "Why me .
Lord?" touched several responsive chords In me. - - AZ
G&LL has been a source of comfort to me but Is also a challenge to llve more as a
Christian. - - MS
We have been meaning to write you for the longest ttmc. to tell you what a wonderful
newsletter you put out: and I feel it ts one of the most Important newsletters In the
community. -- TX
The level of faith and belief 1n God and His goodness Is astounding 1n your writers. I
feel a kinship In our Journey. May they never be let down, or let Him down. - - RI
I am. very glad to hear of a Chruitlan prospectus which la 1n touch with the gender
community. I want to be able to def'-end my convictions: and I know. truly 1n my heart,
that the barrier to us la made by society. Being CD/TO/TS docs not automatically give
a person a one way ticket to hell. - - PA
I enjoy being a man but also enjoy crossdresstng. You r articles In G&LL arc
comforting and I fully agree: God loves us - - anyhow! I'm sure the femtntne side of me ls
an asset which can further the Lord's work. - - MS
I really appreciate G&LL. It has really helped me accept my crossdresstng. I love my
rebirth in sptrltuallty. I am praying for you . the staff writers. and the gender
community. --ID
