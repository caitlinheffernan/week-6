THE RESURRECTION is the epicenter of belief. It is, says C. H. Dodd, "not a belief that
grew up within the church; it is the belief around which the church itself grew up, and the
'given' upon which faith was [is] based. (From "The Jesus I never Knew" by Philip Yancey)
Make no mistake: if He rose at all
it was His body;
if the cells' dissolution did not reveroe, the molecules
reknit, the amino acids rekindle,
the Church will fall.
-Novelist John Updyk (Also from the book with
apologies author Philip Yancey)

The Words of St. Paul"lf we preach that Christ was raised from death, how can some of you say that the dead
will not be raised to life? If they wont be raised to life then Christ Himself wasn't raised
to life, And if Christ wasn't raised to life, our message is worthless and so is your faith.
1 Corinthians 15:12-15 Contemporary English Version (CEV)

The Governor's soldiers led Jesus into the fortress and brought together the rest of
the troops, They stripped off Jesus' clothes and put a scarlet robe on Him. They made
a crown of thorn branches and placed it on His head, and they put a stick in His right
hand. The soldiers knelt down and pretended to worship Him. They made fun of Him
and shouted, "Hey you king of the Jews!" Then they spit on Him. They took the stick
from Him and beat Him on the head with it. When the soldiers finished making fun of
Jesus, they took off the robe. They put His own clothes back on Him and led Him off to
be nailed to a cross.
Matthew 27:27-31 CEV.
The soldiers nailed Him to the cross where He hung for 6 hours suffering and dying and
fulfilling what God had decreed, "The soul that sins, it shall die" Ezekiel 18:4 KJV.
This was God incarnate fulfilling His decree in the person of Jesus Christ.
He died. He was buried.
On the morning of the third day, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the
tomb to annoint the body of Jesus.

Mary. Mary Magdalene. The Mary from Magdaia, a town on the southwest coast of the
Sea of Galilee. Mary Magdalene of no noteriety but simply being one of certain women
who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities. "Mary, called Magdalene, out of
whom went seven *Demons; and Johanna, the wife Chuzas, Herod's steward; and
Susanna and many others who ministered to Him of their substance. Luke 8:2-3 KJV.
She was also at the crucifixion. See Mark 15:40 She is not to be confused with the
sinful woman who annointed Jesus' feet in Luke 7 36-50.
Could not the Apostles held an "excutive Council" meeting and appointed a committee
to greet Jesus as He arose from the tomb and congratulate Him on a successful
resurrection? No they couldn't. They had no faith nor did Mary Magdalene and Mary,
the mother of James, and Johanna and other women (Luke 24:10) when they went to
annoint Jesus' body at the tomb with some spices they had brought. with them for that
purpose. Thier first eye-opening discovery was that a the stone had been rolled away
from the entrance to the tomb. They had been concerned about who they would get to
roll it away for them so they could annoint Jesus' dead body. Their second discovery
was,.the body was gone! Mary called for Simon Peter and John to come and see what
happened. They came and checked out the tomb. None of them knew Jesus was to
rise from the dead. Perplexed, they went home. Mary Magdalene stayed on and
wondering who had taken Him and where they had laid Him. She turned around and
saw a man whom she took to be the gardener and asked him where he had put Jesus
and he said "Mary!" She immeadiately recognized Him and addressed Him "Master!"
Better believe it! He Arose! and He lives! Ask me how I know He lives? He lives
within my heart and I don't have the exclusive on it. He lives in your heart, His salvation
to impart, the very minute you cast your sin-laden soul upon Him. I must write about the
sin question as it applies to USialthough our soul is no different from any other human
being. Our soul is the God hole in us and never rests 'til God fills it and He can, by His
Holy Spirit when you call upon Him. I have an empty root beer can or bottle. It says
"root beer" on the label but it can never fulfill it's destiny until it's filled with root beer and
then it contents can satisfy. Then it is a root beer can or bottle. . Our soul cannot fulfill
a soul's destiny until it is filledwith what it was designed for. The life of God in Christ as
imparted by the Holy Spirit. It's God's home in us.
Quote: "Little or no real journey into wholeness and healing is done without the inner
work of God. He helps us in deep meditative reflection, under the guidance of the Holy
Spirit, to reflect on the mystery of our own lives. those who continue to live without the
release of the true self risk making externals (do's and don'ts) the badge of a Christian
lifestyle which has no correspondence to inner truths. Living the Christian life has
become a burden------a matter of duty more than love. That life of do's and dent's has
not become authentic within. It only conforms without.
Wholeness is a plunging into our inner sanctuary where the true inner self can be
�

gradually released in Christ; where we can come to terms with the true self in Christ;
where the power of the false self can be diminished; where the shadowy dimension of
our lives can be healed by the power of the Holy Spirit". Unquote.
In 1 Samuel 16 :6-7 you will find where I am going with all of this: "...and when they
had come, he (Samuel) looked on Eliab and said, Surely the Lord's annointed is before
Him. But The Lord said to Samuel, Look not on his appearance or at the height of his
stature, for I have rejected him. For the Lord sees not as man sees; for man looks
on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart." ! Samuel 16:7

Thy creatures wrong thee, 0 Thou sovereign Good
Thou art not loved, because not understood;
This greives me most, that vain pursuits beguile
Ungrateful men, regardless of thy smile.

All of my denial has not worked. Now I am ready to explore the issue. I don't know
what I 'II find but I am compelled to see what I can find. G&LL lets me know I am not
alone in my Christian experience as a TG.

*******

I have only recently been able to consider exiting a lifetime of denial and have been
deeply troubled concerning 1 Cor. 6:9 in the King James translation. Of course my
concern is with the word "nor effeminate", in relation to, "shall not inherit the kingdom of
God."
[ I sent a note and sample copy of G&LL and got the following
reply] Thank you for G&LL and the personal note concerning 1 Cor 6:9. yours is the
view I have but was still great:y troubled. I am still not quite certain about TG and even
more uncertain about TS but G&LL is certainly allowing me to develop a new point of
view.
*************

I want you to know that through G&LL you have touched me, along with many others,
and helped me to understand that being a transsexual is a blessing and not the curse I
had always believed it was. Since turning my gender issues over to God 3 years ago,
my life has been a roller coaster ride full of ups and downs. But with a serenity that
comes from knowledge that my new life as a woman helps fulfill God's plan for me in a
major way. You and G&LL helped me to see that.

The Nature of His Love
by James Finley

G

OD'S ENDURING PRESENCE places the false self in a blessed
insecurity. The false self is like a drop of stagnant water thrown
into the raging furnace of the love of God. Even in our sins, in
God's eyes we remain the great pearl for which He has lost all upon the
Cross in order to possess us as His own. Even in the midst of revolt, we
remain His one lost sheep for which He has wandered in the wastes of
death in order to bring us back to His fold.
God never does violence to the essential freedom by which we can
negate ourselves as persons made in His image. But the nature of His
love is such that His affirmation of us always overwhelms our negation
of Him. His loving advance, His covenant love, envelops and upholds
us more assuredly than our next breath.
In this is our hope that nothing shall "separate us from the love of
God which comes to us in Christ Jesus, our Lord" (Rom. 8:39). In this is
our joy that regardless of how distorted our hearts have become,
regardless of what our conscience holds against us, "God is greater than
our hearts" ( I John 3:20).
After one glance of His love, our false self, in spite of all its apparent
imbeddedness, dissolves away like a bad dream. That's all it is any­
way-a bad dream that passes with the dawning of God's love. Our
weakness remains, but it is a handed-over weakness, made strong in its
□
openness and abandonment to God's mercy.

DISCLOSURE
by

Becky Allison
The truth shall make you free.
But does it always?

John 8:32

The guys from my Bible study group
were gathered in the den, cheering or
groaning according to their team preference.
Not I. Liberated from the burden of
watching football, I joined our hostess and
the other women over coffee in the kitchen.
In a group of formerly married women.
the conversation often turns to the demise of
the marriage. I listened with sympathy.
careful to avoid using certain words in my
replies. particularly "husband."
"Construct a past history," I have heard it
advised for persons who have undergone
gender transition. "Know what you will say
about your periods. your hysterectomy. your
husband and children."
I can't do it. Building such a fabrication
is an active falsehood. I was married, but I
didn't have a husband: so I refer to my "ex"
and my "former spouse," and I use the
pronoun "they" rather than "he."
Is this a passive falsehood - lying by
omission? Is it always necessary to tell all
my past history. to "out" myself? I say it is
not. I don't deny my past if asked. but I
don't always volunteer it either.
The Bible tells us that, ea'rly in his
ministry, Jesus withheld some information
about himself.

He drove out many demons, but he would
not let the demons speak because they knew
who he was.
Mark 1:34

This does not mean that I equate my

s

human circumstances with Jesus's divinity.
I do believe that his actions serve as an
example to be prudent about our disclosures.
People perceive me to be a woman. Guess
what: they are right. I am! My past history
is. in almost all circumstances, irrelevant to
my present life. In a similar way, people look
at a recovered alcoholic but perceive that
person to be sober. It is not necessary for
either one of us to publicize past events that
may cause distress and confusion to persons
who know us superficially.
I did not transition in my former home,
but moved to another state. I have chosen
to disclose to a few close friends and co­
workers. all of whom have received the news
with acceptance.
If someone special enters my life, of
course that person will have to know. It
would be totally wrong to withhold
anything from one who loves me.
I have chosen to blend into society as an
ordinary woman. I spend most of my time
dealing with persons who are not in good
physical health. They don't have to be
accepting and understanding, and it's my
calling to care for them with all my skills
and empathy. They trust me. Most would
still trust themselves to my. care if they
knew everything; but some would not.
Perhaps even writing this column puts
me at risk. If so, it is a risk I must take. I
would consider it hypocrisy to discuss a
subject such as this anonymously.
Many of my friends have chosen to be
completely open about their transition.
accepting the risk of discrimination and
rejection. In the long run, this may be the
best and most truthful option.

Which course is correct? Do we "lie by
omission"? Some have called it "blending
into the woodwork." Is it really just living in
a gigantic closet?

Salt adds flavor and preserves freshness.
If we eat food without salt, we may find it
unpleasant and offensive. If our speech is
"seasoned with salt" it means our words are
well chosen to have a pleasant. positive
effect on the listener. We will try to avoid an
offensive, confrontational attitude.

Neither course is inherently wrong. and
my plans may be inappropriate for you. I
suggest each of us seek guidance from the
Holy Spirit for our actions.

Whether we choose to be open about our
gender transition . or to avoid declaring it to
the general public . our motive should be
guided by Christ's love in our hearts.

If we choose to blend in quietly, we must
also be prepared for the possibility of being
"outed" by persons or events we can't control.
The proper course then is the truthful one.
acknowledging without shame or guilt. Our
friends and colleagues will still respect the
person they have known.

Speaking the tru th in Jo ve, we will in all
things grow up in to him who is the Head,
tha t is, Christ. From him th e whole body,
joined and held together by every supporting
ligament, grows and b uilds itself up in Jove.
as each part does its work.
Ephesians 4:15-16

Let your con versation be al ways full of
grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may
know how to answer everyone.
Colossians 4:6

Free At Last

C

HRISTIAN FAITH HAS the power to free us from the world' s particular myths and
idolatries and confusions. The Christian's first mission is to live Christian freedom in
whatever way God gives us to live it, whether it be in the secular world or in the cloister.
The Christ to be preached, whether by word or by silence, is the Christ of Christian freedom,
of Christian autonomy, of Christian independence from the arrogan t demands and claims of an
illusory world. It is not a freedom from the world as nature or as creation, or a freedom from human
society. The Christian is free, or should be, from the psychic determinisms and obsessions and
myths of a greedy, lustful, worldly society.
The secular world pretends to exalt liberty, but it actually enslaves us, making us dependent
on artificial needs, which it then pretends to satisfy. In fact, it subjugates us to what is lower than
ourselves. In and of itself, however, the world does not have any real power over us. It succeeds
in inducing these false needs and these false values only because of our inner needs to feel superior
to, or at least be accepted by, others.
The real masters who rule us and rob us of our freedom are indeed within us. They are our
0
own aspirations, feelings, emotions; habits, and passions.

oy: Dr. J aye Kcvicrc

"I don't believe in a God who is directly involved the lives of humans." went the line in a letter I
recently received. The curious thing about chis communication and h undreds of pages o f painfully
wrough t words preceeding it from the same writer, is that virtually everyth ing this person has
experienced over about the past five years has clearly resulted from the very thing she is saying she
does not believe. Still she rejects Divine intervention in human experience.
The antithesis of this position is o ne we have aU heard in the lovely song from the great musical:
"The Student Prince. " I n this song the lead tenor sings: ''I'll walk with God." Clearly, the lyricist
believes God cares and is involved i n the lives of humans or there could be no resolution o n the part
of a person to walk with God.
Many who are steeped in Philosophy and even in Theology believe in a God who j · 1st set the ball
rolling in some sort of manifestation of creative energy, way back when, and who is n0w merely a
spectator o n the side looking o n to see how it all comes out. To people who believe chis way, a
spectato r God is all they can acknowledge. Actually, for the most part chis kind o f thinking arises
fro m the unanswered questions of science pertain ing to creatio n , or the origi n of the universe.
Science generally holds that the Universe, as we can experience it through astronomy and other
scientific means, began with what they call: "The Big Bang. " There is no progression further back to
identi fy the source of all the matter and energy which were active in the Big Bang theory, but that's
another discussion. What some of these people do suggest is, the ultimate origin o f all thi ngs arose
from some sort of creative energy impulse they sometimes ascri be to God. But they hasten to declare
that once creation was launched and "evolution" begun , G od dropped the b all and became a
spectato r.
Let me state catego rically, I do not ascribe to chis theo retical understanding at all. While I am
aware the Creation Story we have in Genesis I : I was inserted into the sacred writings of the People
of J udah sometime about 3 0 0 to 500 years before the Babalo nian captivity, I see no need to
disbelieve the account of Divine Creation retold in Sc. John's Gospel where it begins: " I n the
beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the \Vo rd was G od." That's enough
detail for me. I ncidentially, if you have problems with the issue of the Divi n i ty of Jesus the Christ,
read and ponder in your heart the first paragraph of Sc. John's Gospel. Lee God speak to you i n
those words and your reservations will pass into praise and thanksgiving.
Transgendered people of all so rts come into associating with each other out of their fundamental
need for soctal interactio� and the approval of at least one other human being. We come from many
educational and religio us backgro unds . Writers commonly assume the people reading their wo rk
share a com mon educational o r a common religious background with chem. Th is is a dangero us
assu mption. It leads to things being said which are not understood in the context in which they are
said . This leads to disputes and disagreements when what we really need is a commonality o f
experience i n o u r faith in order that we might b e strong and positive proclai m i ng o u r faith. Three o f

by Terri L Main
I was in church one Sunday and during the altar time, the
pastor asked for congregation member s to come down
.::::front and pray with people at the altar. I have done a lot of
altar wotk in my life and there was a tugging at my heart
to go down and pray with one individual in particular.
Nob ? d3/ was praying with her, and she seemed to need
some support . In my heart I said, " I sure wish I could go
and pray wit h her, but what would people think if they
saw me. the church transsexual, mini stering at the altar. "
And in that still, small voice of the spirit God spoke to my
heart and said. " How long are you going to k eep using
that excuse. ' '
Like always, God' s voice brings enlightenment and
conviction. He was right . In the midst of all my internal
posturing about how much I wanted to be used in
Christian service he saw me fall for one of the lies the
enemy uses to neutralize so many transgendered
Christians: " You can 't work for God because of your
gender i ssues . "

that well . " O f course , I ' m right.
Nevertheless, even today I too often give place to the
ex� use that my ?ender issues make me unfit for ministry
This excuse cames many disguises . Let ' s look at a few of
them.
I . You aren 't good enough to work for the Lord This
one is powerful for two reasons: it piggybacks on our own
shame, and it is in one sense truthful. Let ' s look at those
reasons. Most of us carry a load of shame around with us
about our gender issues. B eing told that you are a pervert
or a freak directly or indirectly by so many people you can
begin to believe it yourself. But look at what God says
about you. He says you are a " royal priesthood, a holy
nation. " He says you are a " new creation. " He says you
are a " Child of God . " Those are great antidotes to shame.
This excuse is also powerful in that no one, regardless of
personal issues, is worthy to work for the Lord. We are
made worthy by his power working within us. So, when
we work for him, it is really him working through us, and
who can call the vessel God chooses to use unworthy.
2. What will people think. This one is thorny because we
can err by being too concerned about what people t hink.
But we can also err by being too little concerned about
others. Within the context of your service for the Lord,
t hough, the attitudes of others need to be placed second to
the call of God. Yes, some people will have problems with
you serving God. But if you serve God with love and
humility, they will either get i n, get out, or get out of your
way.

After one particularly distressing incident in a church
setting, I decided I would simply arrive late, leave early,
sit in t� back of the church and avoid speaking or
interact,irl@ with anyone. I would go to church, but I
wouldn't get involved . But God didn 't call his people to
be uninvolved . He called us to community. He called us to
serv ice. And i t ' s time to stop playing Satan ' s game and
kill off this excuse.

ministry. God isn't looking for perfect people. Just take a
look at the bunch he chose during his earthly ministry.
They lacked faith, acted impulsively, deserted him at the
cross, and turned the world upside down with the Good
News of Jesus Christ If God is leading you, your ministry
will be effective. If he isn't leading you, then regardless of
your gender issues, your ministry will be ineffective.
Remember, it isn't the vessel which refreshes, it' s the
living water in the vessel which quenches the thirst.
5 . Why should l sen,e God when he stuck me with being
transgen<lered?
This excuse presumes that God owes me something
because he saddled me with my gender-conflicted
situation. The corollary to that is that I owe him nothing
for the same reason. There are two things I ' d like to say
about this excuse. First, what made you believe that living
the Christian life would be easy. Who told you that you
would never have any problems? Why does God owe you
a trouble-free life? The fact is we live in a fallen world.
For some of us the problem is being transgendered. For
others its facing disease, poverty, family problems, abuse
and others. God didn't promise a life without difficulty
Indeed He promised that '' In the world you shall have
tribulation, but be of good cheer. I have overcome the
world" (John 1 6. 3 3 )
Secondly, which is more important : your problem or
God' s salvation I can imagine standing before God on
Judgment Day When he asks, " What did you do for me
on Earth? " , what am I supposed to say? " Well, Lord, I
didn' t do anything. But it was really your fault. I mean,
you don ' t know how hard it was living the Christian life
and being transgendered. People didn't like me. They
turned on me. I really · · " And as I speak, will 1 see Jesus
standing by the Fat her silence my litany of excuses when
he raises a nail-scarred hand.
No, that i s not the way I want to face my Father. I want to
walk into that throne room surrounded by those I lead to
the Lord or encouraged with my counseling or enlightened
by my Bible l essons And when that fire is placed to my
works, I want to see gold and silver and precious stones
left over after the wood, hay and stubble have burned
away. How will your excuses hold up under that flame?

I wou ld like t o do something i n t h e area of

help us in th is important min istry.

who took on You my guilt and shame,
Forgive me for the things I do
that bring dishonor to Your Name.

0 Lamb of God, dear silent Lamb,

There 's still much work to be done. Would a
tradition al or m ainstream church turn a
crossdresser out the door? I 'm fortun ate to be i n
the church I 'm i n . I 'l l n ever h ave to fin d out the

who when abused spoke not a word,
Let me not murmur nor complain
when I must suffer for my Lord.

0 Ln m lJ of God, obedien t Lamb,

When I broke under the strain and den ial of my
crossdresser self, I thought at first it simply was a
need to become good at d ressin g u p and to find a
permissable reason to do so. Now I know th at to
be a crossd resser is more than th at. I didn 't th ink
God would 8ver use me but when I let go and
!e arned He has made me this way, He h �s been
blessing my life and has made me a better person .

who meekly did You r Father 's will,
Help me to humbly serve You now,
and when I die, be serving still .

0 La111b of God, my Paschal Lamb,

who sacrificed Your life for me,
I give to You my heart and soul
for ti111e and for etern ity.
