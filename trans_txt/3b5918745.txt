Words of Life from Peter
On theJewishfeastofPentecost, after the
Holy Spirit had come down upon the believ­
ers, Peter preached his first sermon:
"Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of
Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you
by miracles, wonders and signs, which God
did among you through him, as you your­
selves know. 1lris man was handed over to
you by God's setpurpose and foreknowledge;
and you, with the help of wicked men, put him
to death by nailing him to the cross. But God
raised him from the dead. freeing him from the
agony of death, because it was impossible for
death to keep its hold on him.... God has raised
this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of
the fact Exalted to the right hand of God. he

has received from the Father the promised
Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now
see and hear.... Therefore let all Israel be
assured of this: God has made this Jesus,
whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ"
When the people heard this, they were cut
to the heart and said to Peter and the other
apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"
Peter replied. "Repent and be baptized,
every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ,
for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit The prom­
ise is for you and your children and for all who
are far off - for all whom the Lord our God will
-Acts 2: 22-24, 32-33, 36-39.
call."

1

Years later, Peter wrote these words to
encourage the early believers:
"Praise be to the God and Fath{'l' of our
Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has
given us new birth into a living hope through
the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
dead....Though you have not seen him, you
love him; and even though you do not see him
now, you believe in him and are filled with an
inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are
receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation
-1 Peter 1:3, 8-9.
of your souls."
May this inexpressible and glorious joy
be yours this Eastertime and always!

Jesusdidn'tsay''MyFather andMy God
but He made it very plain that we belong to
God. God is our Father and our God as well.

My whole life I have felt different, per­
verted by what is considered normal for soci­
ety .. Growing up in farm country made ex­
pressing my femininity and crossdressing
impossible. So I grew up playing the tradi­
tional macho game, loud, vulgar and drunk. I
guess this made me feel in line with what I
believed society wanted me to be. I tried to
bury my femininity, my caring, my compas­
sion, deep inside through a hare of smoke and
alcohol.
A year ago I decided I did not wantto hide
my sensitive female side. I like myself when
I am looking and feeling feminine. As I
looked deeper inside I came to the realization
that God did not put me here to be miserable,
and that the femininity I have felt since a small
child was me. God,I believe,wants me to be
happy, and to be caring and sensitive to the
needs of others,regardless of my appearance
and attire. I now have more inner peace and
comfort with myself since letting God know
I'm happy with myself and letting Him in.

Just Who Are You ?

Grace and Lace Letter In1ernati.onal

by Dr. J aye Reviere

There is a scene reported in the Gospels
(Read it in: Matthew 16: 13-16 ) in which
Jesus asked the Disciples: "Who do men say
that I am?" Various answers were given to
him. Finally, he is reported to have asked:
"Who do you say that I am?"
Let's consider this issue ofJesus' identity
for a moment
First in this Bible story, let ' s update the
language a bit The update is simple. Change
the word: "men" to read: "people" and leave
the rest of it intact
Next, consider this: Do you think Jesus
was concerned about what other people said
about him? Do you think Jesus was concerned
to the degree he wanted to know so, perhaps,
he could project an identity that would comply
with what others were saying about him? Do
you think Jesus wanted to know so he could
assume the role in life other people were
trying to define for him?
If you think any of these things, I chal­
lenge you to think again. I challenge you
possibly to revise you thinking to just the
opposite.
I believe Jesus knew exactly who he was.
I believe Jesus knew exactly what other people
thought or tried to "name" him. I believe Jesus
knew the role in life other people were trying
to define for him. I believe what other people
thought or said about him meant nothing to
Jesus.
So, why was he asking these questions?
Do you suppose he asked them to instruct his
followers? Do you suppose this scene is re­
corded in the Gospel for our instruction?
I think Jesus knew exactly who he was,
exactly what he was,and exactly how God had
made him to be. He had no questions. He had
no doubts. He knew,and he accepted the who,
the how, and the what God had made him to
be.
Indeed, Jesus asked these questions to

instruct his followers as to who he really was.

Further, this scene is recorded in the
Gospels to instruct US as to who HE really IS.

If we, as individuals, are to know and
then to BE who,to be how,and to be what God
has made us to be, it is essential for us to
understand some things. It is essential for us
to understand, to acknowledge and to put into
action in our lives is the unwavering belief that
we, as believers we are IN Tiffi CHRIST,and
therefore, we are among children of God. If
we are to know the assurance of being free to
be as God has created us, we must also know
and rejoice in the fact of our being among the
Children of God! There can be no room for
doubt
Being a child of God does not mean
having our thinking, our attitudes, or our
actions controlled by what other humans think.
Being a child of God means having our think­
ing, our attitudes, and our actions controlled
by the Will of God, as God personally reveals
the Divine Will to us. Being a child of God
involves knowing, accepting, and living as
God has designed us to be to the degree God
hasrevealed the Divine Will to us individually
in ten11S of our need to be the who, the how,
and the what we are made to be.

I don't think so.
For the same reason, I think we humans
have a real problem facing us in our relation­
ship with God when we waver, when we
quibble, when we hold back, when we often
outright refuse to live the life God reveals
plainly to us.
Why do we do this?
We fear. We fear what other humans will
say about us. We fear what other humans will
do about us. We fear what will happen to us,
at the hands ofhumanity. We fear truly to LET
GO and LET GOD. And in our fear we fail to
trust God totally.
Does our failure to trust God totally mean
God loves us any the less?
No. There is no shrinking of God's Infi­
nite Love for us. Rather,God's unconditional
love for us shows us a strong contrast reveals
to us even more of the Infinite nature of God's
Love. God loves us IN SPITE of our fear, in
spite of our failures to trust totally. God just
simply LOVES us!

Now, in the case of Jesus, his knowing,
accepting, and living out what God had de­

opposition even from his closest friends, to ___
fulfill the will ofGod. Jesus was determined to
walk the path God had laid out before him. For
this resoluteness,for this determination,God,
at the time of his Baptism,proclaimed Jesus,
before all the world,to be,as the words we are
given say: ".... my Beloved Son in whom I am
well pleased."
Do you think God would have said these
words ifJesus had wavered? Would God have
made this proclamation had Jesus not reso­
lutely accepted and submitted himself to the
Will of God, with full knowledge of all the
facts and implications about who, what and
how God intended him to be?

that no matter what I achieved in my educa­

If they only knew...they would not love
me. I tried to structure my life so no one would

But God knew. God had to know the

loss of my position in a conservative church.
The knowledge in my heart grew stron­
ger. It had a name - transsexualism. The day
came when the need to be true to my heart
overcame my fears.
In that day I discovered the love of my
God is greater than any fear. I gave my fears
to God and experienced his love in a greater
measure than ever before.
The things I feared were not resolved
favorably. In fact, most of them happened just
as I had feared. But God's love sustained me
throu gh my losses and created love in me to
reach out to others who shared this experi­
ence.
All through God• s Word we see it: "Fear
not Do not be afraid." God knows our ten­
dency to let circwnstances terrify us. And yes,
God definitely does care.

died down and it was completely calm.
He said to his disciples, 'Why are you so
afraid? Do you still have no faith?'"

could even say that fear is the opposite oflove.
When we fear, we are saying to God, "l am not
trusting in your love."
What have we to fear? In the Old Testa­
ment, the "fear of the Lord" referred to the
reverence in which we hold God - holy, sepa­
rate, almost inaccessible. Such a reverential
awe helped the ancient Israelite mind under­
stand the majesty and greatness of God.
But in Jesus Christ we have God the
accessible. "Love the Lord your God," he
said. He is our guide for this love. His selfless
love bought my freedom from sin and fear.
What have we to fear? Persons who
claim to speak for God may reject us. That
which they have not experienced, they do not
understand, so they condemn us. But our God
does not condemn us. Our God loves us with
an infinite love which he places into our hearts
to love others as he loves us.
"Who shall separate us from the love of
Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecu­
tion or famine or nakedness or danger or
sword? No, in all these things we are more
than conquerors through him who loved us."
Romans 8: 35, 37
Titls love enables us to have the courage
to live our lives in truth and without fear.
Nothing can happen to us that will separate us
from God's love. Given this ultimate assur­
ance, we can live day by day on a higher plane
of existence.
What have we to fear? If we have given
ourlives to God throu gh Jesus Christ, we have
no need to fear. He will always be with us. He
will never leave or forsake us.
'There is no fear in love. But perfect love
drives out fear, because fear has to do with

So the problem is not usually motivation,
but rather understanding. So, then how do
people often misunderstand transsexualism.
First, they confuse it with homosexuality.
Homosexual liaisons are definitelyproscribed
by scripture. I know that may offend some
readers, but that's the way it is. However, I
might add that the same passage that con­
demns homosexuality also condemns jeal-

I might addwe arenot exempted from the
obligation to love our brothers and sisters in
the Lord simply because they do not under­
stand us or they condemn us. We still must
love them and worry less about winning them
by fighting, and more about winning them
with our love.

Now, before condemning the actions of
Christians who vo cifero usly oppose
transsexualism, remember that their motives
are noble, even if their actions are not If I
believe that you are doing something that will
cause eternal harm to you, I have a moral
obligation to try to save you from that harm.
The best analogy is that of a person wandering
out into a street and not seeing a car racing
toward them. A bystander would have a moral
obligation to warn that person that a car was
coming. Such is the motivation of the Chris­
tian warning a person away from sin.

What is the source of this feeling? The
answer is simple: Ignorance. Ignorance of the
nature of transsexualism and ignorance of
scripture combine to cause many well mean­
ing Christian people to brand transsexualism
as a sin.

experience. I personally prayed and read my
Bible. I personally experienced the presence
of God in my life. Around our house, God was
no philosophical construct; He was an objec­
tive reality like another member of the family.
As a child and teenager, I had one major
prayer, "Lord, please either make me a girl or
make me like other boys." The Lord in his
wisdom did neither. I didn't see any conflict
between being a transsexual and being a Christian. I still don't, but now l know that there are
others who do.

People who condemn transsexualism as
a sin, not only are ignorant of gender issues,
they are also ignorant of the Bible on this
subject This area simply is not covered in
scripture one way or another. It falls into the
category of "working out your own salvation
with fear and trembling."

I think the name transsexualism is what
throws a lot of people off. They seem to take
the "sex" part as referring to the sex act (an act
many of us on hormones would find difficult
to perform anyway) rather than to gender. I
prefer to talkaboutgender dysphoria. It sounds
more clinical, and it is more accurate. It usu­
ally won't lead people to misunderstand the
sexual connotations of the condition.

Other people view this as erotic fetish­
ism. While fetishism is not specifically pro­
scribed, it is nontraditional sexual behavior
and as such is usually considered undesirable
or even sinful. Again, though, the transsexual
is not necessary a fetishist He or she wears the
clothing of the opposite sex because he or she
feels most natural in those clothes, not be­
cause of erotic stimulation caused by the
clothing.

Transsexualism, though, is not homo­
sexuality. It is a gender identity problem. At
some point in my future life I may decide to
-marry and have sex with a man. But I would
be a woman at that time. I have no desire to
have male to male sex. Some transsexuals will
have otherexperiences beforeand afterSexual
Reassignment Surgery, but only in the ap­
proximate proportions found in the non-trans­
sexual population. All transsexualism is is
having the identity of one sex and the anatomy
of the other. The only act that transsexuals .
wish to perform is the surgical and social
transformation into the gender of their mental
identity.

ousy, pride, envy, hatred and wrath, qualities
too often found (and excused) in many church
people including ministers. But like my folks
always told me " two wrongs don't make a
right" It does put the question in it's proper
perspective.

Luanna came into her office canying a
cup of tea and a piece of paper. "Terri," she
said, "I have another client - transsexual - who
attends a fundamentalist church. She's facing
some turmoil over her role in the church. I said
that I had another client who was also in­
volved in the church and she was interested in
talking with you. Here's her nwnber. Maybe
you could give her a call."
Well, of course, Terri gave her a call.
Now, we call back and forth a few times a
week. But recently, I've had several questions
about the place of the transsexual in the church.
Maybe this means that it is in God's timing to
discuss this difficult is.sue in a formal essay.
Talking about THE CHURCH is sort of
like talking about THE COMPU1ER or THE
1REE or THE BIRD. Each church denomina­
tion is different In fact, each local congrega­
tion is different Even such designations as
Fundamental, Pentecostal, Charismatic or
Evangelical have variations. So, maybe I
should clarify the perspective from which this
essay is written. I am writing from the point of
view of orthodox, fundamental Christianity. I
am writing as one who believes the Bible to be
the revealed Word of God, who believes that
Christ was the Son of God in substance as well
as spirit, who believes that Christ' s death on
the cross acted as an atonement for the sins of
the world, who believes in a personal god, a
personal salvation and a personal relationship
with God through Christ Much of what is said
in this piece would apply to any mainstream
Christian denomination including both Prot­
estant and Catholic. I will try to keep denomi­
national doctrine to a minimwn. But so you
will know, I regularly attend an Assembly of
God church which is a full-gospel, evangeli­
cal church. (Okay, so we 've had some person­
nel problems in recent years. But those
televangelists are no longer with the denomi­
nation.)
I remember growing up in the church. I

"

-- --.
---Two scriptures which some point to as
condemning transsexualism are De uteronomy
� 5 and 1 Corinthians 6.9. In the first,"wear­
ing apparel pertaining to a woman" is con­
demned. I might add in the next verse so is
taking a mother bird away with her brood
building a house without a parapet, and sow�
ing a vineyard with two different kinds of
seeds. In unders tanding this scripture we must
look at the cultural setting. In many idolatrous
practices great orgies would be held in which
men and women would crossdress for the
purposes of sexual arousal and ritualistic in­
discriminate sex. Such bacchanals often ended
with some m_en castrating themselves and
becoming eunuch priests to pagan goddesses.
From the transsexuals point of view we are not
men wearing dresses, we are women • in
training before SexualReassignment Surgery
• in body afterward. In fact, it is most appro­
priate that we dress as women since it is proper
for women to wear women's clothing. I might
add this is the only scripture in the entireBible
dealing with crossdressing at all. It is poor
hermeneutics (scriptural analysis) to build an
entire doctrine from a single verse,especially
a verse from Old Testament law most of
which has been superseded by the grace of the
new covenant in Christ
The second scripture lists a series of types
of sinners who are not to inherit Gods king­
dom. In the King James version this reads. "Be
not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idola­
ters, nor adulterers, nor EFFEMINATE, nor
abusers of themselves with mankind, nor
thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor re­
vilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the king­
dom of God. And such were some of you: but
you are washed,you are sanctified,but you are
justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by
the spirit of God." (I Car. 6. 9- 1 1) The word
effeminate. is the word which causes some
people problems. However, it is a
mistranslation. Itis better translated Catamite.
Catamites in Greek cultures were young ho­
mosexual prostitutes. But the word also air
plied to those who purchased their services as
well as those who managed their careers.
M ost modem translations use either
"catamite," "homosexual," or "sodomite" as
more accurate translations.
So, if it is not specifically condemned by
scripture how then can transsexualism be
viewed? Well, in my opinion, (please under­
stand this is simply my opinion) I believe it
can be viewed in much the same manner we
would view a birth defecL ff there is a defect
which can be cured by surgery, most Chris-

tians would applaud the medical community
as an agent of healing. They would not say
''That's the way God made you, you should
�Y as you are" to the person with a club foot,
with a cleft palette, or even with a crooked
nose, big ears or other facial features which
could be corrected by surgery. Why should
the same be said to the transsexual who simply
wishes to live a normal life as a woman. Not
a perverted life. Just a simple, and in the case
of the Christian transsexual,virtuous life as a
woman.

There is one other gauge the Christian
has to judge an action. That gauge is the peace
of God. At salvation, the Holy Spirit puts a
type of spiritual barometer inside. It quickens
the spirit when an action is considered which
is wrong. From personal experience, I have
the peace of God about what is happening. I
don't always understand what is happening,
but God gives me his assurance that He has
everything under control. His presence holds
me firm when the painful episodes come. It is
His presence and peace which has kept me
away from the booze, the pills and the noose.
Without that peace I'm not sure what I would
have done a few years ago. I might not even be
here writing this essay.
About ninemonths ago,I was crossliving
part time. Attending church alternately as a
male and a female (different churches). I was
wondering whether I might have been mis­
taken so I set forth a test for myself. I prayed
and said, ''Lord, I give up. I want to do what's
right So, I won't try to crosslive daily or set
any routine for my �ing. I will simply go
by the unction of your spirit As I feel,so will
I dress. It's in your hands now, Lord. And he
spoke to my heart, "Finally, you're seeing
things my way." I have never felt the leading
of the spirit to dress as a male ever again.
My transition so far has been amazingly
smooth. I have seen literal miracles of finance,
timing, and circumstances occurred. In short,
I have seen the hand of God in everything that
has happened so far. I believe God has a
purpose in this. Romans 8:28 says "God wades
all things together for the good of those who
love him and are the called according to his
pmpose."(Literal Translation) A looser trans­
lation put it this way, "God is putting all the
pieces of the puzzle together. " To me that is
exciting. In the words of an old song of the
church "I don ' t know about tomorrow. I don't
seem to understand. But I know who holds
tomorrow. He's the one who holds my hand."

An A pology from Davi d
My last year has been extremely difficult
due to ill-health on my part and my daughter
having been near death. Under the circum­
stances, all my energies have had to go to my
family and to my parish. Since I hold the
confidential records, this has meant that the
UK end has been out oftouch. While there are
still problems here, I am beginning to cope
better. The good news is that our membership
is now well over fifty, much of which is down
to the worlc ofJ ay and the Sibyls. For those not
in that grouping I am attaching details of some
of the recent activities. There are now two
chapters in the UK, and the recent residential
weekend at the Royal Institute of St.
Katherine's had 24 in attendance, I believe. I
alsocontinueto meet new transgendered min­
isters, and to have the support of my diocesan
leadership in supporting the community. So
with my prayers for your blessing in 1 998,
over to Suzanne.

Suzanne Says:

Hi! It is good to be writing for the G&L
Letter again. As David says, there is a lot
happening at the moment A new government
appears more sympathetic to our needs, and
the legal system seems to be taking on board
some of the issues that we have been raising
over the past few years. But ultimately our
hope lies in the Lord. (In God we trust - sound
familiar?) If God doesn't build the house, the
other labourers are just wasting their time.
Legal and Civil rights matter greatly, but
salvation is final!
I was looking at the story ofMary in John
13 the other day. If some of the legends are
correct, she had been a prostitute. If the Luke
8 story is an echo of the same situation then the
ointment might have been part of her stock in
trade. Perhaps $400 worth of illusion and
sensory joy. Yes, it could have been sold to
help the poor, or perhaps used for some im­
moral purpose.But instead it was poured out

by Jan ice Van Cleve

Would n ' t it be refreshing to see
transvestism viewed as a positive good in­
stead of a negative, or at best neutral, phenom­
enon? Fundamentalists demonstrated in "The
Bible and Transvestism ", (Tapestry#4 9); psy­
chologists characterire it as a sexually moti­
vated disorder; psychiatrists treat it as an
aberration im printe d by upbringing.
Crossdressers themselves argue that it is a
harmless hobby, a vehicle for appreciating'
softness and tenderness, or an expression of a
feminine side of their nature.
But what if they're all wrong? What if
these characteriz.ations fail to describe what
rransvestism really is? What if instead we try
to look at transvestism as a gift; and not just
any gift, but a gift created by Almighty God
Himself and deliberately bestowed by Him on
certain chosen individuals to fulfill His divine
plan. Zoun�! Awesome! Radical! Yes, and
frightening, too.
Of course nowhere in the Bible does
Christ say: "Hitch up your hose, girls, I've got
plans for you". However, He does reveal a
vision of His gifts to us in all their wonderful
diversity through Paul: "There are different
gifts but the game Spirit; there are different
ministries but the same Lord; their are differ­
ent works but the same God who accom­
plishes all of them in everyone. To each one
the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the
common good...preaching, teaching, faith,
healing, miracles, prophesy, recognizing spir­
its, tongues and the interpretation of tongues.
All these are the manifestation of one and the
same Spirit, who distributes different gifts to
different people just as he chooses" (I Cor.

12:4-1 1).
What's that? You didn't see transvestism
in the list? Paul does not pretend that this short
list includes all of God's gifts to us. He item­
izes more in Romans 12:6-8 and Jesus names
others in the Beatitudes such as meekness,
thirst for justice, peacemaking and the rest
Indeed there are many gifts - named and
unnamed - given to us "for the common
good".

So why not transvestism? There is not
one shred of evidence that this is not a divine
gift Of course when most people think of
divine gifts they think of musical ability,
artistic talent, intelligence, charisma, good
health, etc., but that is obviously too narrow a
view. In a very touching story Jesus showed
even blindness could be a gift "He saw a man
who had been blind from birth. His disciples
askedhim, 'Rabbi, who sinned, this manorhis
parents, for him to have been born blind?'
'Neither he nor his parents sinned, Jesus an­
swered, 'he was born blind so that the works
of God might be displayed in him'." (John
9:2-3) Then He gave the man sight
Christians have always had difficulty
comprehending how a loving, good, and mer­
ciful God could permit conditions that are
contrary to their concept of good. Birth de­
fects, arthritis, an untimely death, even AIDS
- all the frailties of human existence - seem
cruel. Some ascribe these to sin while others
become callous or turn against their God.
Their faith is lacking and Jesus calls them
blind: "If you were blind, you would not be
guilty, but since you say, 'We see,' your guilt
remains." (John 9:4 1)
Is it not possible that even these so called
evils are also gifts of God? And perhaps not
just gifts to those stricken, but to all of us - to
give us an opportunity to show care and love
for all our brothers and sisters. Consider the
story of the Good Samaritan: Was not the
victim an opportunity forthe Levite, the priest,
and the Samaritan to show love for another
hwnan being? But only the Samaritan saw the
"gift" in the situation and helped the victim.
1n the same way Christians and others
often fail to comprehend how transvestism (or
transsexuality or homosexuality for that mat­
ter) could be God's blessing to certain chosen
persons - for their benefit and the benefit of us
all. Instead, some set themselves up as judges
and condemn what their pride cannot accept
"You must love your neighbor as yourself; but
as soon as you make distinctions between
classes of people, you are committing sin",
James warns them. Besides, "who are you to
11

give a verdict o n your neighbor?" (Jam 2:9,

4: 12) Jesus Himself told Peter: "What God
has made clean, you have no right to call
profane." (Acts 1 1:9)

However, any gift may be used for good
or evil. Everything God has created is good
but its ultimate value depenw on what we do
with it If we accept instantly realize that it can
no longer remain a self-gratifying hobby or a
mere aberration to be tolerated. Rather, it
becomes a positive good - a calling or voca­
tion. It is right and morally good to express it
and morally wrong to suppress it Chew on
that, Jerry Falwell! See what power, what
confidence, what affirmation we gain from
accepting this as a gift! "lfGod is with us, who
can stand against us?" (Rom. 8:31) But wait!
Before we charge off to conquer the world,
take note: God's gifts do not come without
strings. Remember the parable of the talents
(Matt 25: 14-30)?
Three servants were given gifts. Two
dared to risk theirgiftsin investmentsand won
a profit The third suppressed his gift - and it
was ripped from him and he was thrown out
If the two had risked and failed, would they
have been punished? I think not God does not
allow us to be tested beyond our strength (1
Cor. 10: 16). The point is, the two acknowl­
edged their gifts and accepted them. With
faith in their master they tried and succeeded.
God's gifts are His investments in us and
He expects a return on the investment Paul's
advice to Timothy applies equally to us: "You
have in you a spiritual gift.. do not let it lie
unused" (I Tim. 4: 14). The third servant did
not use his gift and it was taken from him. The
fig tree that did not bear fruit was ordered to be
cut down (Luke 13:7-8). The Spirit who dis­
tributes these gifts •�ust as he chooses" gives
some more gifts than others. Do not envy
them; for the more they have been given, the
more will be demanded of them (Luke 12:48)
And what return can we transvestites
make on the investment our God has made in
us? Certainly we do not propose to convert the
world to transvestism. That's absurd! We

(and tran$Cxuals and homosexuals) are born
with our gift We can no more teach someone
without our gift to become one of us than a
therapist can take the gift from one who is born
with it Like it or not the gift is given - it is ours
- in us as an integral part of our unique being.
So what do we do with it? Certainly we
have to acknowledge it and accept it Then
what? For starters we can learn from it We
can learn a deeper appreciation and respect for
all people. As a minority we can see more
clearly the stupidity of prejudice. We can
embrace this gift, treasure it, enjoy it, explore
and develop it to its full potential, and share it
with others. We can help those similarly gifted:
removing their fears and roadblocks so they
can become all they were meant to be. "Each
one of you has received a special grace, so,
like good stewards responsible for all these
different graces of God, put yourself at the
service of others" (1 Pet 4: 10).
And when we've learned to appreciate
ourselves and others, and when we've given
help to our sisters, then we can reach out to the
public who do not share our gift We can step
out with pride in the full light of day as
ornaments to our society. After all, ''We are
God's work of art. created in Christ Jesus to
live the good life as from the beginning he had
meant us to live it" (Eph. 2: 10) .

We are needed in society - precisely
because we cross a gender boundary which is
taken for granted so complacently by the
majority. Just by being who we are, we chal­
lenge false assumptions about gender and
genuinely help the public reassess their atti­
tudes. We demonstrate in our being the diver­
sity of God's creative genius, and we help
deflate the arrogance that leads to discrimina­
tion - against us and against other minorities.
We are all members of the same crew on
spaceship Earth and we will all grow or die
based on the contributions of each individual
member. No one could contribute much if we
were all the same, could we? "If your whole
body was just one eye, how would you hear
anything? If it ':Vas just one ear, how would
you smell anything? Instead of that, God put
all the separate parts into the body on purpose-.
If all the parts were the same, how could it be
a body? As it is, the parts are many but the
body is one. The eye cannot say to the hand, 'I
do not need you.' nor can the head say to the
feet, ' I do not need you.' .. God has arranged
the body so that .. each part may be equally
concerned for all the others. If one part is hurt,
all parts are hurt with it If one part is given
special honor, all parts enjoy it" (1 Cor. 12: 172 1 , 24-26).

Rednecks, Jews, men, women, whites &
blacks, Baptists, bankers, gays, crossdressers
and tl'an$Cxuals - even Democrats - all are
here at His command. Is this difficult to swal­
low? Even Paul had trouble with it but he
understood: "I should like everyone to be like
me, but everybody has his own particular gifts
from God, one with a gift for one thing and
another with a gift for the opposite."
( 1 Cor. 7:7)

Accepting transvestism as a divine gift
means accepting also the purpose for which it
was given. That may be too W1comfortable for
most Butthosethatdo accept, acquire also the
power and confidence that comes from being
right - not just correct according to human
logic - but morally right Slander and abuse,
criticism and laughter cannot defeat them.
Their self assurance and open friendliness to
all people win them friendliness in return.
They take their place in society as a contribut­
ing member and the world is better for them.
It's a gift that truly keeps on giving.
