The above prayer is on th title page of ·changing Chan
nets·, a booklet by David
�
Horton about whom you will be reading much in the page
s of G&LL. He is a Rector in
The Church of England.

W�at a contorting thought _and fact. BECAUSE of what I am I can serve the Lord
in a
unique way. The Holy Spirit is not disqualifying you from Christian ministry but you
are.The Holy Spirit has not shut the Church door to you because of what you are. You
have disqualified yourself and slammed the Church door on yourself. There are no
gender police stationed at the Church door to run you off. Mere man has scared you
away with his condemnation . How much negative activity goes on in our minds that
fosters utter condemnation of ourselves. Give your self a Christmas gift that God will
bless and use, Accept yourself exadly as God has made you and then let Him use you
in the unique way He has made you. ·God designed you to live in your situation to give
you an opportunity to be His witness EXACTLY where you are.· (Borrowed). One of
God's transgendered servants is starting a Transgender Bible Study in her home the
first of the year and there is a TG group in Florida which has been doing the same for
almost a year now. They are using their God-given uniqueness to serve Him.
Serve Him who took upon Himself the form of a man (sorry N.O.W. but facts are facts)
and lived for 33 years among and in His Creation and then died for our sins and rose
again· on the third day and 40 days later ascended into heaven and 50 days after that
He came back in the person of the Holy Spirit to indwell all who would put their faith and
trust in Him.. I will never stop admonishing you to take�Jesus Christ into your heart and
life realizing you are like all humanity; born in sin and in need of a Saviour. We are no
different, in that sense, than anyone else. We have the same Spiritual need all humans
have. Give yourself the Christmas gift of Christ in you and the hope of Glory.

..

I have used up the space I wanted to use to thank EACH ONE who has had a hand in
the publishing of G&LL this year. Some have typed for us, many have sent stamps and
contributions and many are praying for G&LL. I can honestly say that the TG community
has made G&LL possible this year and enabled me to add a new publication, "Love
Story" (send for a sample copy). I love each of you dearly.

two irrefutable things. God makes no mistakes and we
are created for a purpose. It is, I believe, up to us to
search and prayerfully seek to find the purpose God has
for us, particularly in having created us to be apart from
the common herd of humanity.

,·

It was cold. A slight breeze blew from the north
otherwise the Sunday morning was spectacular. I'd not
lived in New Mexico long enough to become blaze
about the b�lliant skies and the towering mountains. I
was f�ll of J':'Y as I made my way to Sunday morning
worship services.

' . Toward this end, may I offer some of the things I've
�1scovered in my life journey? We are taught, and
rightly so, as Christians, that we are created in the
Image of God. I submit this is not as so many humans
pres�e, something physical. Rather this Image of God
m which we are created is a purely spiritual image. You
see, God is SPIRIT and has no one physical being, so
God has no physi�al image.

The heels of my pumps clicked as I suppressed a
shudder of delight, a shiver from the cold and kept my
pace deliberate. The walk from my Blazer to the front
door of the church was short, but if I'd not had on a long
skirt, heavy and appropriate for the winter's chill, it
would have seemed far longer.
Inside, a young lady met me. After a warm greeting
hug, came a question: "Jaye, how can you stand
wearing a skirt in such cold weather?" My mind raced a
moment. "I don't mind the cold," I replied, "when the
wind swirls up the south end of my skirt, it reminds me
I'm not wearing hated pants!" She laughed warmly.
Over the past dozen or so years a good deal has been
written about the psychological issues involved in being
a crossdresser. This involved developing knowledge as
to why we are as we are.
With the powerful sweeping rising· of religious
fundamentalism, we are continually bombarded with a
straightlaced stereotype. We don't fit the stereotype of
what a heterosexual male is thought properly to be. We
are very different. Fundamentalism with all its
_
emphasis on Bible literalism and law, sees us as bemg
something horrible and an abomination.
Just what really is the situation? Are we an
abomination in the eyes of our Creator? Are we sinful
just because we are as we are? Are we offensive to other
. Christians? What of life for us?
These are vital questions. They are concerns with
which we need to deal and come to a piace of peacefui
assurance for ourselves. These are issues each of us must
resolve individually. No one else can resolve them for
us. Each is between the individual and God.
What those of us who have walked long upon the
road of faith can do, however, is share our thin.king arid
our experiences with others. In this sha�in� we can
perhaps offer some light, some room for msight, and
some reassurance that the constant drumbeat of
fundamentalism pounding in our ears has not deafened
us to the still small voice of God, who created us as we
are.
That's right! It is God's idea for us to be �iffer�nt. We
can't know the mind of God. We can only infer it fr<:>�
the revealed word, from the movings of �h� Holy Spmt
within, and from what our pitifully h�ited human
_
senses can detect. Because we are, 1t 1s abundantly
evident we are made to be as we are. We are assured of

----,�--

·

Now, God being spirit sees not what is external in
our physical sense and in the physical realm which was
made merely to support and sustain the spirit beings
we are while we are living in the physical. I have come
to beiieve, it is essential for us to be the spirit beings,
within the confines of this physical realm in which God
has places us, in just the way God made us to be. For
those of us who find being different an essential
element of our being true to our creation, we must be
different in order to be as God intends us to be.

In this way of understanding, we are an abomination
in the sight of God when we work so very hard to be
anything other than what God made us to be. When we
deny, when we hide, when we repress, and when we
go overboard or extremes, we are not being what God
made us to be. When we are doing these things, we are
an abomination before God. When we go simply,
quietly, respectably, and reverently about being the
human being God made us to be, then we are a joy to
our Creator.
This defies the literalism with which fundamentalists
impose a mean and angry demanding face on. G�d.
This is I have come to believe, how God sees us: ms1de
rather'than superficially. If our spirit is in concert_ wit�
the Holy Spirit dwelling in each of us, the outside 1s
totally immaterial.
Because God made us as we are, our being who,
what and how God made us is obviously not sinful. We
offend our Creator (sin) when we try so very hard to be
what humans say we should be when this is
inconsistent with what God made us to be.
We are in some cases, offensive to other Christians.
This poses ethical issues for us. I sat in church
demurely, with my �kirt well �o�n around my ankles,
although it was qwte :war� ms1de, and offended no
one. This church is one m which many gay people come
together to worship. I had called and been _ assured I
would offend no one BEFORE I went ther� in a _dress
the first time. This was the ethically responsible thing to
to some
do. Yes, we are offensive in some. cases

�hat ?f life for us? This is the rhetorical questi�n
whic� cn es ou t for an answer for each of
us It ·
q� estion _only t he individual can answer. It is a
ques ��:
wit h which I �ve grappled in my personal b
ein for
g
�any years. It 1s a qu esti on for which resolution b an
eg
m prayer.
I hated being different. I hated the desires I h
ad I
hated the scorn with which I was treated if I allow�d
so�eor:ie �!se to see me as I really was. I hated
not
bemg h�e one of the g uys". I hated bein feminine.
I
g
hat ed bem left out. I hated all these thin
g
g s and more I
hated all this because I hated myself. I hat
ed mys�lf
because I was different.
I lay � prayer. The prayer was in profound anguish.
I was defiant I was angry. I was hostile to my God. I
,was demanding. I was a petulant child demandin to
g
be how I wanted to be, not hew God made me to be. I
was demanding to be how humans said I had to be not
'
how Almighty God had chosen for me to be.

.

.

My �ne wa y �o�versation wi th God was angry,
d�m andmg, �d ms1stent. Then it was interrup ted. I
thmk G od fin ally h ad enough o f my being like a
stubborn two year old kid who demands to have his
way even when a l ovin g parent knows there is a far
better way.
An a �� o!11e voic�, still, soft, a bit an� sounding,
yet mf1ru tely loVIng and tender spoke m my spirit.
The words are burned in my soul forever: "How dare
you not want to be as I have made you to be! How dare
you indeed!"
an d

My attention was comm anded instantly. A peace
se t t led o ver m e a n d I be g an t o e xperience
comprehension. My personal t heolog ical back ground
had been very fundamentalist and I was more than
merely conversant with the literalist interpretations of
the Bible which abound in fundamentalist thought. I
· began to see the impossibility of human comprehensi on
of the Bibl e in purely in tellectual terms. Human
intellect cannot grasp t he infinite because human
in tellect i tself is finite. With this conclusi on, I was
astounded and doors to spirit ual understanding began
to open wide.
Then I began to realize, God had indeed made me as
I am. Afterall, my spirit b ore witness to the awesome
presence of the Holy Spirit who had spoken those awful
w ords: "H o w d ar e y ou ... " in my so �l. With this
realiz at i on there cam e a peacefulness abou t bein g
differe nt , a peacefulness I cannot describe. Suddenly, I
be gan to understand God had made me different for
God's purpo ses. I didn't know them then and I don' t
know them now. It is enou gh for me to know they are.
The "How dare you... " of God kept rin g ing in my
soul as I began more and more to let g o of my
fundamentalist thinkin g and began to hear more and
m ore of the far rriore profound teachings of other groups
within the traditional and liturgical church. It all began

t o make Il_'Or_e �- ti my human intel
lect could not
grasp th� 1nf1ntt
e simply because it is not big
enou gh,
and if God had m ade me different, then I had
to be as I
.
am m order to be faithful to my Creator. I had
to let 0

my h�� id
eas and human self directi on an
d sim �
walk m faith believing the Holy Spirit within was
doh/
, �hat God promised: takin care of all the details
of m�
g
life.
Wha � of the ethical issues we raised earlier? Like
every thin g else, they are under th e uidance of the
H o�y Spir! t . I don' t have any hard angd fast rules by
which to live. I am aware as St. Paul said, I am free in
the Lord to be who, what, and how God made
me to be
bu t � will W:illingly and even gladly deny myself
ex�rose of t his freed om so that I not offend a
weaker
believer.
Parenthetically, I mig ht add, I am convinced in the
very co�e of Il_'Y being, those who stiH stru le with
gg
�heir faith �y imposing jud g ement s based on h uman
mt �llectual JJ_tt�rpretation of spiritual thing s are weaker
�elievers. This 1s not to say I am anything special or am
m any war �t r�nger or be tter than anyone else in the
_
�a1th . �o, 1t 1s JUS! that in this one aspect, this thin g of
imposing human Judgements on divine c onsiderations
�hose_ who continue to walk by the sight of human
mtelh gence and not by faith alone are weaker. I am
weak and others are weak. Some are we aker than
others. Those who live by h uman jud ements are
g
among those weakest.
In t h e wisd om of God, som e o f us are created
different. Some of us are made in a way in which we do
not fit the common m old. It is God's ch oice and the
exercise of God's divine right for t his to be. It is our
challenge to be who, what and how God has made us
and to do so gently, lovin gly, and in considerati on for
the feeli ngs and weaknesses of those who are ordinary
and who are vulnerable to bei n g harmed by our
unwise use of the freedom God g ives us to be the
people we are created to be. The single ethic I propose
is this: give no offense when there is a way you can
avoid giving it without compromising and surrendering
your faith and your -.,·ery being as God's created person.

This ethic applies, I believe in all cases. It applies in
comings and goings and especially in our personal
relationships wit h those with whom we are most
involved. It particularly applies to our families and
those God has given as our friends. Tellin g members of
our families, sharin g crossdressin g with our friends, and
being open about wh o , what, and how we are with
others is a constant concern. Each case, each relationship
is a unique case, and to each unique case the one ethic
applies.
our

My best sugg estion is: be wh o. what, and how God
made you to be. but don't rub the noses of others in
your freed om. Give n o intentional offense and you are
living ethically.

Unlik � �ur,.gear sister � ee Frances, 1 am

work - ' � in electronics. As an electronic
te <:!1 mc1an f have a toolbox containing
various tools ranging from simple pliers
and screwdrivers, to some rather strange
looklng tools for special task to some
rather complex and expensive meters and
oscilloscopes, all - there to facilitate my task
of repairing a VCR· or a stereo. I also have
a wide array of service manuals 1 a sort of
road map of the u nit I am repairing.
Perhaps of all the tools that I have at my
disposal, thfs Is the mos� important for it

find the problem at fault.

Many of us have a sort of toolbox. For a
computer programmer it may be some disk
with special programs on them to assist
him in writing programs, for the person in
pu blishing it may be a drawer or box
containing things like paste and scissors
and other items for publishing. The doctor,
the accountant, the bridge builder; we all
have various types of tools to facilitate us
in doing our job.
And just as we have a toolbox 1 so too
does God have a toolbox. Of course just
as I have service manuals in my toolbox,
God has the bible in his toolbox. It is his
road map for us to leam of him and his
plan for us.
He also has ministers,�
evangelist, musicians, and various other
people all there to facilitate his task of
getting his message out to the people.
Often times we may ask 'Why me Lord,
why do I have this affliction of
crossdressing?" The religious right says
that this is wrong, that you do not want me
because I crossdress, and yet I did not

r

cho� o th� llfa IC carr-only usum a that
you chos� It for me. WHY? For what
PY � did you mak e me this way ?•
I can only assu me that a pers on who is
gay Is asking God the very same
_
questions . Why did God not make us like
' norm al peop le?
I recall the movie "OH God" where God
came to an ordinary person and told him
that he had a special message that he
needed him to deliver to the worfd. It has
been quite awhile since I saw the movie,
and I do not recall John Denver's
characters name. but
do recall his
s � eptlctsm when George Bums Introduced
· himself as God .
I can imagine · the
thoughts of this person that God came to

r

Come on now, I've seen those pictures in
my bible, I know what God looks like.
WHO ARE YOU? Like many of us. he was

arso asking "WHY ME?" -

Just as we suffer many afflictions due to
our crossdressing so did this person. His
wife thought he was crazy, the _doctor
thought he was crazy, as I recall he even
lost his job in attempt to do what God had
asked of him. Of course the various
biblical people also thought he was crazy.
Come on now, if God has such an

important message he won't ask some mr.
nobody to deliver it, he have me do it, after
all I am a great tele-evange/lst, I lead the
largest church in the world I am much
more important I'm .... . . . . •
As we look in the bible we notice that
when Jesus was on this earth, he went to
some rather common people to deliver his
message. He took h is message to the
outcast, and other low life of the time. · Of
course he tried to bring it to the' various
religious leaders of the time, but like the
religious leaders in the movie, they
doubted him, Your not /he Son of God,

yourjust another nutcass.

I often wonder how many sisters I have
who were like me, yearning to be close to

S

God. and because of the. teaching Qf the ·
rel ig ious rig ht felt that God. did not want
them simply bec°ause of our crossdressing . �
Would you be close to God tod·�y if it were
not for a sister, a sister reassuri ng you that
God does love you , and that Jesus died
j ust as much for yo u as for the relig ious
rig ht?
Our being crossdressers is but one of
the man y tools that God has in his toolbox,
sort of like my s p ecial pu rpose tools. We
are here for a s pecial job that God has for
us. God has a pu rpose for each and eve ry
one of us , and we as tran sgendered
peop le can rest assured that our
transg endertsm Is but a necess_a ry tool to
his accomplishing that pu rpose he has for
us. Would this newsletter even exists if
our dear sister was not transgendered?
1 Samual 1 7:6. reads �The Lord does
not see as mortals ·s ee, mortals look on the
outward ap pearance , but the Lord looks on
the heart." In the song "HE L NES" the
choirus reads •he lives, he lives, Christ
Jesus lives today; .......... , You ask me how

I know He fives, He fives 'Mfhln my heart�

If Jesus lives within our hearts, then it is
not necessa ry for us to seek out God
pu rpose in lffe for us , but rather God will
show it to us , He will make his p urpose
known unto us , and when he does, you will
understand that being transg endered is but
one of his tools to accom plishing that
pu rpose he has for us.
Though the relig ious right may q uarrel
with us, rest assured that GOD LOVES
YOU! If Jesus lives within your heart, then
he died as much for you as he did the
relig ious right.

Dear Bible Belt,
What a wonderful question! Since so
many religious people are sincerely in­
terested in holding to the basic value
system of the Bible, it is important to
understand when you seemingly are not
in sync with a biblical injunction.
Deuteronomy is the fifth book in the
Old Testament. De1,1teronomy is sup­
posed to be a farewell address by
Moses. In the first three chapters, he
recounts the journey from Mt. Sinai to
the land East of the Jordan. Starting
with Chapter 4, he challenges his fol­
lowers to be obedient to the "statutes
and ordinances". He urges loyalty,
gratitude, and obedience in view of the
imminent settlement in Canaan and the
dangers in this settlement. A real con­
cern was that the Canaanite religions
not be incorporated into the Hebrew
experience. Beginning with Chapter 1 2
th rough 25, Moses gives a n endless se­
ries of legal regulations, including rules
for worship. The essence of the laws are
outlined in Deut. 10: 12-22, where ac­
cording to G. Ernest Wright, a well­
known Old Testament scholar, "God's
requirement is that his people shall rev­
erence him, love him, and serve him
with heart and soul."
According to The Inte rp reter's Bible,"
Deuteronomy 22:5 is a law which ap­
pears only in this one verse in the Bible
and is "directed against the simulated
changes of sex in Canaanite religion. " It
seems to he guarding the Hebrews
against the immorality of impersonat­
ing members of tl1e opposite sex for
vulgar and lewd pagan ritual. In
Canaanite religious practice such ex­
change of garments was generally for
immoral purposes. Jt was a form of
idolatry; a major evil for the Hebrews
was idolatry.

ON BEING

YOUR.SELF

By R.ev. Ki.in Lee Brown,

Founder of AUil.ORA, Mid-'M i_u ippi TranagEnder Group
:

The � aturd � y night be fore I was to del iver what I hoped would
be an enl ightening me ssage at I FGE ' s At l anta Act ion 9 5 , I sat on
the f ront porch of Dal las Dennys home wi thout a c lue as to what 1
shoul � s ay : I s at in the qu � e t peacefulnes s o f the night praying
and l i s t ening for a reve lat ion . But nothing came other than the
coo l l i ght from the stars and moon .
Ea � ly the next morning I returned to the porch for more
m� d i. t a t ion and hope fully some inspiration . . But now the peace o f
night was gone . The sky was f i l led with a cool ye l low light and the
air was f i l led wi th the morning sounds of peop le rushing to work .
Unexpectedly , that which I sought came to me . God spoke . Hot in an
audible vo ice , but powe r ful j us t the same . There is a place for
darkne s s and - a place for light , th& mere exi s t ence o f one does not
des troy the other . Bach complements the other and if you look you
can f ind beauty in both . However , it was the twi light which spoke
so powe r ful ly to me·. I t is this p l ace in t ime when the birds can be
heard s inging , and it ' s the twi l i ght where the rest ing f lowers open
t he ir f aces to greet the day . Suddenly I realized that we are l ike
the twi l ight , ne ither night nor day . We are that per fect mixture of
each where the birds can s ing and the f lowers open .
Thi s reve lat ion i s impor t ant to me because I have always tr ied
to f ind my p lace in the wor ld . I read all the wr it ings about gender
peopl e in history and I f e l t bet t er . But something was s t i l l
mi s s ing . I a m more than j us t a part o f the gender community . Hy
l i f e i s a part o f a l l l i f e on this p l ane t . I am part of the dawn .
Without the dawn there can be no morning . I take s a l l parts to make
the day complete and it take s us , j us t as we are , to make humanity
comp l e t e . We are indi sput ably a part of the greater humanity . And
humanity has a lways sought i t ' s place and purpos e in the univer s e .
I now know that I am no accident . I have a place and a
purpo s e . Hy problem is that I have always been in conf l i c t with
that purpose . I wanted to be the day and when I could not , I wanted
to become the night . I was never content unt i l I accepted mys e l f as
what God made me , a transs exual , ne i ther night nor day , but a part
o f the dawn whe re the birds s ing and the f lowers open .
I was l ike an old car I used to have . I t was my car . I could
do what ever I wanted to do with i t . It was mine . When the pr ice of
gaso l ine rose to more than , 1 . 00 per gal lon , I decided that I
wasn ' t going to put it in my car anymore . I f i l led it with water .
Do you know what happened? I t didn ' t run . Why not ? I t was m� car !
The answer is obvious . The car was not de s i gned to run on water . I t
was des igned t o run o n gasol ine .
I fear that many peop le in our community are l ike I was , and
l ike my car they cannot funct ion prope r ly . We can change our
appearance and our act ions , but we cannot change what we are . To do
so prevent s us f rom funct ioning prope r ly .
I am trans s exua l , I cannot funct ion at my be s t as either a
ma l e or f ema l e . And i f I am t r anssexua l I should not be expected
