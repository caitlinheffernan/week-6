ON BEING MISLED

N

O one wants to be misled.
At least, no one does when
they take a moment to
think about their personal
relationship with Jesus Christ.

Still there are a lot of folks who
seem to be fully inten t en
misleading the unwary. There are a
lot of human reasons for this, of
course. In and under these "human"
reasons such as ego and power
issues, there is but one real reason.
Jesus Christ has promised us,
no one can pluck us out of His hand.
This means, to me, even the
supernatural Enemy, Saran is
powerless to remove someone from
the place of Grace Jesus Christ has
given them The Enemy knows he
has lost the struggle ro control the
person when they placed total and
childish!Y simple FAITH in Jesus
Chnst. So... the Enemy does all he
car_i to �nterfere with a person's
domg this. He uses people to do his
dark work too.
Well intenti1:med people, people
who honestly think they are doing
others a valued service u-::wittingly
. erve the purpose of the Enemy. It
1s n«:>t only those dedicated
worshipers of Satan who serve his
purposes. People who proclaim

anyrhj�g �ur che Supremacy nf the

Propmanon ofJesus Christ for rhe

"redemption" (buying back of
somet�ing previously held) of
human,ry also serve the purpose of
the Enemy. Jesus has said: "I am
rb._e way,

the Truth and the

Light, no one comes to the
Father but by Me." Anyone
who reaches anything different
from what Jesus taught does so in
service to the Enemy.

The Enemy uses many tools.
The Enemy is supernatural and thus
�nfi_ni_tely more powerful and
1nfmttely mo re intellectually
capable than even the most astute
of us humans. In dealing with him
we have but one infallible source of
strength: The Holy Spirit of God
We are promised access to the
!nfinite _power of God when we
mvo_ke tt in the Name of Jesus
Chnst. Only in this way can we
blunt _ t he assa�ts of the Enemy in
our hves. Without this infinite
Divine Power Jesus Christ gives us,
we are helpless in contests with
the Enemy.

Once a person submits all of
herself or himself to the Lord Jesus
Christ, in total commitment to the
promises of Jesus Christ, then the
Enemy has no more power to
remove her or him from the very
hand of Christ.
The Enemy can still harass and
still trouble the believer. If the
Enemy can harass the believer into
doubting her or his faith, the
Enemy can render the witness of
the believer null and void.
I� the Enemy can't "have" you,
he will certainly try to neutralize
you, try to make you ineffective and
useless as a servant to Jesus Christ.
He does this in many ways.
If you are a crossdresser, you
are a ready made target for the
Enemy's number one weapon. The
�umber one weapon the Ene1�y uses
�s qurLT! With guilt the enemy
msnlls a sense of unworthiness and
sinfulness without any promise of an
escape. He seeks to keep us focused
o n how miserable and how
unworthy we '.11'e by piling on the
sense of guilt. He does this
endlessly!
Our worthiness is not at issue.
Jesus Christ has settled all issues
of our value to God, by taking our
sins with Him to the Cross and
there paying the price we do not
have die ability to pay. The Enemy
w�ul� confuse us, misleading us into
thinkmg we must in some way earn
our place ofjustification before the
Throne of God. He uses this and
our inate knowledge of the Law to
instill guilt at every tum. None of us, no human knows
the wonderful Divine written Word
of God as well as does the Enemy.
He knows just what verse or
section to use to hammer us into
feeli� guilty as � way of weakening
0':1f Faith and hoping to destroy our
wtmess.
Deuteronomy 22:5 is one of the
Enemy's favorite texts when it
comes to making a crossdresser feel
guilty. The Enemy knows Jesus
Christ has already fulfilled Ali the
requirements of ALL of the LAW
for us because our sinful nature
makes it impossible for us to fulfill
them for ourselves. But, unless WE
know this and unless WE WALK in
a si�ple . CHILD LIKE FAITH,.
knowmg Jesus Christ did in fact
PAY IN FULL THE PRICE WE
J

COULD NOT PAY; then the
Enemy has us right where he wants
us: over a barrel; a guilt barrel.
There is but one reliable way
by which the believer can verity
the teaching of one sucn as this
writer: TAKE IT TO THE
LORD IN PRAYER! The Holy
Wo·d tells us to test the Spirits for
no wimess can testify Jesus Christ
is Lord unless by the power of the
Holy Spirit. Likewise and by
extensi�n, no teacher, preacher,
theologian, etc. can set forth Divine
fnl�h ll:"less it be by the power and
1nsp1ranon of the Holy Spirit.
. Do not believe what any human
wntes or says; nor even this one.
Belie�e w_hat the Holy Spirit
dwelling 1n you validates and
confirms. Take not my word for it...
Take it to the Lord Jesus Christ in
Prayer.
So for the crossdresser, when
doubt and guilt come upon you, the
EOW�r is yours in the Name of Jesus
Christ, to tar n aside the
blandishments of the Enemy and to
send him packing.. in thus to renew
your Faith and your JOY in Christ.

J. Reviere Ph.D. DD '/A

A faith full of faith,
Ike a dam filled to the top
will find its way out or over.

A heart full of love
will seek a heart that needs filling,
It is the nature of the full, to fill.
A soul changed by grace
will praise, speak and sing
so that others might come
to their own place
of new life and love.
It can be turned off,
but not silenced,
sent away
but certain to return.
There is a place deep within
that can be made full
with anything more or less
than that which if real, alive, of God
and deep l)lace filling.
This is faith not contained
in work or deed alone,
but rather one which comes
in power and Spirit,
making all the difference in the world
and in the world to come!

Christian Deeds, Not Words

un your race in harmony with the
mind of God. You must - every
one of you - join in his choir, so that
being harmonious and in concord, and
taking the keynote of God, you may
sing with one voice through Jesus
Christ co the Father, so char he may
hear you and through your good deeds
recognize that you arc parts of his
Son. It is advantageous for you to live
in blamdess unicy, so char you always
share in God.
But pray constantly for other men,
coo, for in their case there is a hope of
repencance - a hope chat they may
find God. Permit chem to be in­
structed by you at lease through your
deeds. To their anger, be meek; to
their boasts, be humble; to their abuse,
utter your prayers; co their error, be
steadfast in faith; to their sangcry, be
gentle, never desirous of imitating
chem. Show yoursdves to be brothers
and sis c�:� by forebcarance, and be
zealous . _ imitate the Lord, and deny
yoursdvcs, so that no plan of the devil
may be found in you, but with all
purity and sobriccy you may remain in
union with Jesw Christ in both flesh
and spirit.
_
These are the Im times: lee us fed
shame at our shortcomings; lee us fear
the patience of the Lord, that it may
not result in our condemnation. Let us
fear the wrath that is to come and love
the grace that is now; lee us be found
in union with Christ, living the crue
life. Let nothing attraa or distraa us

apart trom him.
Be zca.lous to meet together more•
frequently to give thanks to God and
to glorify him. When you meet to­
gether frequently, Satan's powers arc
destroyed, and his destructiveness
comes to nothing through the har­
mony of your faith. There is nothing
better than uuc peace.
Nothing can escape you if you have
perfect faith and Jove fur Jesus Christ,
who is the beginning and the end of
life. Faith is the beginning, and love
the end. And when the two arc bound
together in unicy, they arc G�. and
everything dse chat contributes to
goodness follows from them. No one
who has faith sins, and no one who
possesses love hates. The tree is known
by its fruit. Similarly, those who pro­
fess to belong to Christ will be recog­
nized by their deeds. For it is not a
matter of what we now profess, but
that a man continue in power of faith
to the end.
It is better to be silent and be, than
to talk and not be. The man who is
really possessed of the word of Christ
can hear even Im silence. so that he
may be perfect and may act through
what He says and be known through
His silence. Nothing is hidden from
the Lord, but even our secrets arc near
him. Let us do everything with a sense
that he is dwdling within us, so that
we may be his temples, and he be
-:::..
within us as our God.
from l.m6 to tht Ephaums

For each soul that exclaims, "Spec�
Lord, for Thy servant heareth," there
are ten that say, " Hear Lord ! for Thy
servant speaketh "-and there is no
rest for these.

PLAY IT AS IT LAYS
by
Rebecca Anne Allison

Hear now the parable of the talents.

A man going on a journey called his
servants and entrusted his property to them.
To the first he said, "Here is five hundred
thousand dollars. Invest it exactly as follows:
one hundred thousand in Consolidated Camels.
two hundred thousand in First Jerusalem
Savings and Loan. and two hundred thousand
in Galilean Fishing Enterprises. You will enjoy
riches and live a life of ease.•
To the second he said. "Here is fifty
thousand dollars. It isn't enough for a !ife of
ease. but it will get you started in your own
business. If you work hard. you will survive
and perhaps even prosper a little.•
To the third he said. "Here is five hundred
dollars. It's your severance pay. You will live
your !ife outside the shelter of my blessings.
You will. however. still have to gaze upon these
others. the ones for whom life may be easy or
hard. but is always normal.
"You will envy them for their normal lives.
because yours will never be like theirs. And yet
you must attempt to be normal. It will be in
vain. for you are not normal as they are. But
woe to you if you attempt to accept or embrace
abnormality ! Other men - normal men - will
reject you and cast you into the darkness. where
there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
STOP!
This is not at all what Jesus said in t he
parable of the talents. I think. however. that it
is what many of us believe.
We see those few who live in the fine
houses and drive the fine cars. They seem to
lead charmed lives. We think. 1 could be just
like them - if I hadn't had this life�ong burden
of gender identity conflict."
1
l
We see the much larger number of
ordinary working people. and we identify with
them. Perhaps we have been quite successful in
our transition. and we blend into society in our

proper gender. Yes. we appear to fit in. But to
ourselves we think. 1f these people knew my
past, they would reject me. For I am not normal
like them."

Too often we see ourselves as outcasts - in
our own eyes. and more importantly, in the eyes
of God. "God does know my past. and he knows
I am not normal. Therefore God has rejected
me."
Well. now. Just who says you are not
·normal"? Is it God? Or is it Satan. laying the
guilt on you to defeat you?
Who created you? God did. you say. Yes.
he did. And did he create within you a conflict
between the person you appeared to be and the
person you knew you were in your heart? Or
was this just something you chose to do on
your own?
Chose? No. I didn't choose it. you say. I
know I have had it as long as I can remember. I
think I was born with it. On t his point. science
would agree with you. Transsexualism is
biological. not a learned behavior.
Listen to these verses:

you.

Before I formed you in the womb. I knew
Jeremiah 1:5

Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker.
to him who is but a ootsherd among the
potsherds on the ground: Does the clay say to
the potter. "What are you makingT Does your
work say. "He has no hands?"
Woe to him who says to his father. "What
have you begotten ?" or co his mother. "'What
have you brought to birth ?"
Isaiah 45:10
God made us just the way we are. We may
feel deformed. like a broken potsherd. But in
his plan. we are just as he intended. We are
beautiful in his eyes.

God wants us to deal with our inner
conflict. He will give us the strength to deal
with it. Almost certainly. he will not simply
remove the conflict; he will guide us to its
resolution. That resolution for us is to become
congruent in body and spirit.
The cliche from the language of golf is
"play it as it lays.· We don't go back to the tee
and start the round over. We have to play out
of the rough.
We don't ask him to let us start our lives
over with no conflict. We have to deal with our
lives as he created us.
God doesn't reject us; he never did. Neither
will most of our friends. if they see his beauty
and love in us.
So now let us redo our paraprhase of the
parable of the talents.
A man going on a journey called his
servants and entrusted his property to them.
To the first he said. •you will enjoy the
riches of life. Just remember. to whom much is

given. much is required. I expect you to use
your blessings to bring my love to others. I will
give you the power to do so.•
To the second he said. "You will not have
an easy life. but through hard work you will
realize satisfaction and success. I will give you
the power to bear the toil of daily life."
To the third he said. 1 love you as much as
my other servants. But I am giving you a
different burden. This burden will handicap
you for years. and will require great strength
and patience to overcome.
"But this burden is the gift I give you. Do
not bury it. Take it. accept it. and use it to find
fulfillment in your life.
1, your Lord and master. will give you the
power to resolve your burden and live the life I
intended for you. When you have done so. you
will know my joy and peace. Your life will be
sweeter than ever as you know completeness;
as you realize that you are - and have always
been - normal. as all my other beloved
servants."

Many Chri , ·

being told t , . . eace md blc11ings wi11 come to us when • and i/ • we are ri ght with God.
Because of
Jesus acc omp lished for us on the Cro11, we are ri ght with God . . . but we still have
problem,. ·
ere in Scripture are we promised no problems, p ain, or suffering. We're never told in
Scripture t: .u-om the moment we come into a relationship with Go d, we'll do no wrong, 1ut no p ers on,
feel no p a1i
have no sickness. Well-me aning Christiana have told us these things, but theyre wrong.
Rather, Sen ture tells us that we'll know true p eace , His p eace, in the midst of all our trials and
tribulations - that He will be there with us in the midst of it all.
Many of U1 are tired of pretending, tired of putting on a mul ing face when our hearts are broken and we're
hurting.
We want c. cone to be there, someone to care, to strengthen and IUSlain us, whatefer our situation We
want to t
,co� d, but most of all , we want to be loved ... loved wifu.j1£ tams O!" � or

our lives.
know we are loved unconditionally . . . and the Good Ne,n is, we can - in God Thia l onging
; na1 love, this 'void" inaide of us, is God-given. He created il And only He baa the c ap acity
d Father always intended to fill us with His love. He's there for each of UI , j ust waiting for

God lov
, all of us, not because of anything we do, but because of who He is. That's the Good News of
the Go sp .
d that love will never change . It will never diminiah or dinppear becauae of anything we do.
The only v-7 , we can lose that sense of His love will be if we step outside of Him and take the control of
our lives ck into our own hands.
So, when I've messed up my life in some way, no matter how badly, I've learned to not take rrr, eye s off
Him Over the years I've learned to qui ckly run to Him and hide there ... secure in His mns, ri ght where I
was always intended to be, re sting in His unmerite d, unearned, and unshakable unconditional love for me.
