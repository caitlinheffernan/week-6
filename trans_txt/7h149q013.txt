But who are you, a mere man, to criticize and contradict and
answer back to God? Will what is formed say to Him that
formed it, WHY Have you made me this way? (Rom.9:20)
•
Pllalm
139:13-16

13 For You did form my inward parts. You did knit me together in my mother's
womb.
14 lwill confess and praise You for You are fearful and wonderful and for the
aw(e)ful wonder of my birth! Wonderful are your works, and that my innerself knows
right well.
15 My frame was not hidden from You_ when I was being formed in secret [and]
intricately and curiously wrought [as if embroidered with various colors] in the depths
of the earth [a region of darkness and mystery].
16 Your eyes saw my unformed substance and in Your book all the days [of my
life] were written before ever they took shape. When as yet there were none of them.

Our Life Before Our Life

By Lee Frances

Quote, "Thou art the owner of my inmost parts and passions: not the indweller and
observer only, but the acknowledged Lord and posessor of my moat secret aelf.
God does not only inspect and visit, but it is His own: He is as much at home there as
a landlord on his own estate or a proprietor in his own house. 'You did knit me
together in my mother's womb.' There I lay hidden, covered by You. Before I could
know you, or anything else, You had a care for me, and did hide me away as a
treasure till you should see fit to bring me to the light. Thus the Psalmist describes the
intimacy God had with him. In his most secret part. Yet unborn, he was under the
control and guardianship of God.
' My frame (my substance) was not hidden from You.' The substantial part of my
being was before Your all seeing eye; the. bones which make my frame were put
together by Your hand. The essential materials of my being before they were
arranged were all within the range of Your eye. I was hidden from all human
knowledge but not from You. You have ever been acquainted with me. When I was
made in secret. Most chastely and beautifully is here described the formation of our
being before the time of our birth. A great artist will often labor alone in his
studio, and not allow his work to be seen until it is finished; even so did the Lord

fashion us where no eye beheld us until every part of us was complete. Much of the
formation of our inner self still proceeds in secret. And curiously wrought in the
depths of the earth. Embroidered with great skill is an accurate description of the
creation of muscles, veins, sinews, nerves, etc. What tapestry can equal the human .
fabric? God's intimate knowledge of us from the beginning and even before it, is
here most charmingly set forth. Cannot He who made us thus wonderously when we
were not (yet born), carry on His work of power till He has perfected us, though
we feel unable to aid in the process, and are lying in great sorrow and loathing, as
though cast into the lowest parts of the earth?
'Your eyes saw my unformed substance, yet being unperfect.' While yet the vessel
was upon the wheel the Potter saw it all •. The Lord knows not only our shape, but our
substance. 'Yourur eyes saw.. . ' moreover the divine mind discerns all things as
clearly and certainly as men perceive by actual eyesight. His is not hearsay
acquaintance, but the knowledge which comes of sight.

.. . and in your book all the days of [my life] were written before ever they took shape.
When as yet there were none of them. An architect draws his plans, and makes out

his specifications; even so did the great Maker of our frame write down all our
members in the book of His purposes. That we have eyes and ears and hands and
feet is all due to the wise and gracious purpose of heaven; it was so ordered in the
secret decree by which all things are as they are.· God's purposes concern our limbs
and faculties. Their form and shape and everything about them were appointed of
God long before they had any exalatence. God aaw us when we could
not be seen, and He wrote about us when there waa nothing of ua to
write about. When as yet there were none of our members In exslstence.
All of those members were before the eye of God In the sketchbook of
His foreknowledge and predestination." Unquote.
-By Charles Haddon Spurgeon. From Vol. Three of his, "Treasury of David"
Published by Hendrickson Publishers

" ... despise not what others are or have, though they are not such exact peices,
though they have not such excellent endowments as yourselves; yet they are what
God has made them. Despise not what yourselves are. many are ashamed to be
seen aa God made them."
-Abraham Wright. 1800's
As I was copying the above I perceived the activity of God in putting us together and
framing our lives and writing it all down in His book of life. He knows our end from the
beginning. He knows us before we exit the womb. I take great solace today in
knowing God knew from the beginning I would be a transgendered person. · This is
the way He made me. I don't know how anyone, cg-tg-ts, can think God is mad at
them because of our lifestyle. Our life, before we ever entered the womb, was laid out
for us. He entered us in His book. To try to understand is far greater than our human
understanding can conceive. The course of our lives was laid out by Him in His book

just as an architecht lays out the plans for a house before the first peice of wood is
ever purchased, before the foundation of the house is laid. The owners who have
never seen the house know exactly what it will look like and exactly how it will be
constructed. So it is with our God and our body of flesh. Our God, who was never
created but always was and always will be and unrestricted by time, knows every fiber
of our being.
Is God going to get "mad" at the way He created us? Cd-tg-ts was not our choice in
life. We entered the womb this way and the construction of the body began. It's the
Satanic force that makes us hate ourselves and makes us feel we are offending God.
Does the vase the potter made tum around and ask WHY? have you made me this
way (Romans 9:20)? No, the clay has to accept the way it's made into a vase to ever
display the beauty of the flowers put into it. God has given us a beauty of soul that
only each individual posesses. We are gentle, loving people. We are genuinely
caring pepole. Our basic nature is inoffensive, plus many other positive traits. He
made us according to His plan and only His plan in us and for us can satisfy Him.
· Everyone, including the mighty bastion of the Church, has tried to remake us and it
can't be done. THEY are the ones mad at us. Not God.
Stop pronouncing Judgement on yourselves. ACCEPT the fact you are made as God
made you. I am well aware that in many cases you must live your God given feminine
life in secret and away from family, friends and employers. It's not a great way to live
and that sets forth the dire need to worship our creator. The church service opens
and the moderator says, "The Lord is in His Holy Temple" meaning the church. Yes!
The Lord IS in His Holy Temple. Our bodies. !Corinthians 6:19, Amplified; "Do you
know that your body is the temple (the very sanctuary) of the Holy Spirit that lives
within you, Whom you have received [as a gift] from God? You are not your own.." Too
many are trying to live without Him because they believe the lie of satan that they are
not acceptable to God because of being cd-tg-ts. Liar!, liar, your pants are on fire.
Accept His love for you as His creation in the turmoil of our lives (and I have, to this
very day, turmoil with my children because of my tgism) We don't cut God out of our
lives. Stop and thank Him for His love for you.. Give Him your heart in love. Worship
him in the silence of your being. You don't have to be in church to do that.
·Before I was aware God made me a cd I used to get all dressed in my Sunday finest
and sit in my closet with the drapes drawn and door locked and turn on one of these
TV evangelists and just sit there singing along and praising the Lord. I have sat in
Churches sending up my own personal praise and worship totally oblivious to the
service going on around me. God has blessed all of it. I was in the drunk tank in a
New York City jail in 1961 and went to a church service there and discovered the
verse in the bible that changed my life. Jeremiah 29:11 KJV, "I know the thoughts I
think toward you, saith the Lord. Thoughts of peace, not of evil, to give you an
expected end." That was the first revelation in my unsaved life that God had any
thoughts at all about me. God thinks GOOD of me, wow! Cool, cool! He got me
locked up for public drunkeness to tell me He was thinking of my peace and welfare.

At that time of my life God was the ONLY one that thought good of me. As I prayed to
Him in succeeding months there was a Divine deliverance from the alcohol I was
addicted to (which had robbed me of wife and family and put me on the Bowery in
New York City) Praise His Holy Name!!! I tried to pray away my cding but to no avail.
Alcohol, smoking and the overuse of prescription drugs all went down the tubes into
Gods forgetfulness but cding? no. Why, He made me this way and when I learned
that ; I became a transgendered person and have been blessed by Him in so many
ways since then. Gosh! the above is a departure from my writing of this article.
Perhaps someone will be encouraged by it all.
Back on the track now. God saw the state of man, totally corrupted dripping with sin.
That's when He became a human being in the person of Jesus Christ. He had
decreed death to all of us for our sins. Not for our cding, tging or tsism. He made us
this way! He came among us and took our sins upon Himself and paid for. us the
death penalty He had decreed. But what good is a dead Saviour. He knew sin
wouldn't stop. The flood taught Him that. His death didn't remove our sin but paid the
penalty for it. Sin, past, present and future. Of course, if you are saved and never
sinned again since Christ came into your life, please advise me. I'm looking for such
a person. God knew we need His personal strength in our battle with life and to
accomplish that for us, He rose from the grave where His dead body had been laid.
He was taken "up" into heaven from where He sent His Holy Spirit to indwell us. That
occasion is commorated with what we call the Day of Pentecost.
Thus, before the womb and even to this very day God has been and is with us. He
loves us AS WE ARE, AS HE MADE US. Why not love yourself and love Him and
. take Christ into your life?
God bless you and keep you for His Glory.
I am yours, with love, in the joy and happiness of our Saviour and Lord, Jesus Christ

I am· a believer who inaeasingly HY8S in exile from the traditional way in which Christianity has heretofore
been proclaimed.• A believer in exile" is a new status in refigious circles, but I am convince<.i ihat
count;ess numbers of people who either still Inhabit religious institutions or who once did will resonate
with that designation.

The hunger for God is deep and pervasive in our society today. We need to recognize that this is not the
same thing as hunger for the answers the church has traditionally given. Indeed, many seekers today do
not act as if the church wHI ever be a plaoe_ where God can be fruitfully sought.
Bishop Jotn Shel,y Spong i'l his latest book, Ol'istitl'ity MJSt Olm,ge ex Die
To be born again is to discover ourselves as infants In the gracious arms of God. There is nothing we can
do to make God love us more. There is nothing we can do make Him love us less. We cannot manipulate
God. He wont pay more attention to us if we figure OtJt how to become His favorite child. We assume that
· God's love for us must be tied to something-our performance, Oll' saaifices or at least our love for Him.
But Saipture is rather clear about this. God's lova for ue 18 rooted In His own merciful nature.

PLAY IT AS IT LAYS

By Dr. Becky Allison

Hear now the parable of the talents.
A man on a journey called his servants and entrusted property to them.
To the first he said," Here is five hundred thousand dollars, invest it exactly as follows:
one hundred thousand in Consolidated Camels, two hundred thousand in First
Jerusalem Savings and Loan, and two hundred thousand inGalilean Fishing
Enterprises. You will enjoy riches and live a life of ease . "
T o the second he said, " Here is fifty thousand dollars, it isn't enough for a life of ease,
but it will get it started in your own business. If you work hard, you will survive and , ·
perhaps, even prosper a little. "
To the third he said, " Here· is five hundred dollars. It's your severance pay. You will
live outside the shelter of my blessings. You will, however, still have to gaze upon
these others, the ones for whom life may be easy or hard, but is always normal . . You
will envy them for their normal lives, because yours will never be like theirs. And yet
you must attempt to be normal. It will be in vain. You are not normal as they are. But
woe to you if you attempt or accept or embrace abnormality! Other men-normal men­
will reject you and cast you into the darkness, where there will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth. "
STO P ! ! ! !
This is not at all what Jesus said in the parable of the talents. I think, however, that is
what many of us believe.
We see those few who live in the fine houses and drive the fine cars. They seem to
lead charmed lives. We think, "I could be just like them if I hadn't had this lifelong
burden of gender-identity conflict. " We see the much larger number of working
people, and we identify with them. Perhaps we have been quite successful in our
transition and we blend into society in our proper gender. Yes, we appear to fit in. but
to ourselves we think, "if these people knew my past, they would reject me. For I am
not normal like them. "
Too often we see ourselves as outcasts-in our own eyes, and more importantly, in the
eyes of God. "God does know my past and He knows I am not normal. Therefore
God has rejected me. " Well now! Just who says you are not "normal ?" Is it God or is
it satan laying the guilt on you to defeat you? Who created you? God did, you say.
Yes, He did. And did He create within you a conflict between the person you
appeared to be and the person you knew you are in your heart? Or was this just
something you chose to do on your own?

...
Chose? No, I didn't choose it, you say. I know I have had it as long as I can
remember. I think I was born with it. On this point science would agree with you .
Transsexualism (and Transgenderism , ed , ) i s biological , not a learned behavior.
Listen to these verses:
God says, Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you . Jeremiah 1 :5
Woe unto him who quarrels with his maker, to him who is but a potsherd (a
worthless broken peice of pottery) among the potsherds on the ground . Does the clay
say to the potter, "what are you making ." Does your work say, "He has no handles. "
Woe to him who says to his father, "what have you begotten?"Or to his mother,
"what have you brought to birth?" ( Isaiah 45: 1 0)
God made us just the way we are. We may feel deformed , like a broken potsherd .
But in His plan . we are just as He intended . We ar beautiful in His eyes.
God wants us to deal with our inner conflict. He will give us the strength to deal with it.
Almost certain ly, He will not simply remove the conflict; He will guide us to it's
resolution . That resolution for us is to become congruent in body and spirit. The
cliche from the language of golf is "play it as it lays. " We don 't go back to the tee and
start the round over. We have to play it out of the rough .
We don 't ask H i m to let u s start o u r lives over with n o conflict. We have to deal with
our livesas He created us.
God doesn 't reject us. He never did. Neither will most of our friends if they see His
beauty and love in us.
So now let us redo our paraphrase of the the parable of the talents:
A man going on a journey called His servants and entrusted his property to them .
To the first . he said , "You will enjoy the riches of life. Just remember, to whom m uch
is given , m uch is required . I expect you to use your blessings to bring my love to
others. I will give you the power to do so.
To the second He said , "You will not have an easy life, but through hard work you will
realize satisfaction and success. I will give you the power to bear the toil of daily life."
To the third He said , " I love you as much as my other servants but I am giving you a
different burden. This burden will handicap you- for years, and will require great
strength and patience to overcome.·
" But this burden is the gift I give you. Do not bury it. Take it. Accept it. , and use it to
find fulfillment in your life."
" I , your Lord and Master will give you the power to resolve your burden and live the
life I intended for you . When you have done so, you will know my joy and peace.
Your life will be sweeter than ever as you know com pleteness; as you realize that you
are-and always have been-normal as all of my other beloved servants."

M a ny Ch risti ans a re hurti ng -- i n our fa mil ies, our jobs, our health , our
ma rriages -- a nd we ' re tired of be i ng told that peace and blessings will
come to us whe n, and if, we a re right with God .
Because of what Jesus accomplished for us on the cross, we a re right
with God . B ut we still have problems. Nowhere in the Scri ptures a re we
promised no proble ms, pai n , or suffering. We ' re neve r told i n Scripture
that from the moment we come i nto a relationship with God, we ' l l do no
wrong, h u rt no pe rson, fee l no pa in, or have no sickness. We l l-mea ning
Ch ristians have told us these things, but they' re wrong. Rather, Scripture
tells us that we ' ll know true peace , His peace , in the midst of all our
tria ls and tri bulations. That He wil l be there in the midst of it all.
Many of us a re tired of prete nding, tired of putting on a smiling face when
our hea rts a re broken and we ' re h urting.
We want someone to be the re , someone to care, to stre ngthe n and sustain
us, whateve r our situation. We wa nt to be encouraged, but most of all, we
wa nt to be loved -- loved without terms or strings or conditions, not j ust
when we' re be ing good a nd doing the right things, but especially when
we 've messed up our lives.
We all need to know that we are loved u nconditionally -- and the Good
News is, we can, in God. This longing for u nconditiona l love, this "void"
inside of us, is God give n . He created it. And only He has the capacity to
fill this need. Our Heave n ly Father a lways i ntended to fil l us with His
love. He ' s there for each of us, j ust waiting for us to acknowle dge that we
need Him. All we have to do is invite Him in.
God loves us, all of us, not beca use of a nything we do, but because of who
He is. That' s the Good News of the Gospel. And that love will never change.
It will neve r diminish or disappear because of anything we do. The on!y
way we can lose His sense of love wil l be if we step outs ide of H i m a nd
ta ke control of our l ives back i nto our own hands.

Deeper Life , some times called Victorious Life , comes from the New
testament
where Paul talked about the Deep Things of God .
In Math . 22: 1 4 Jesus says that many are called, but few are chosen. This
statement
comes right after He tells the story of the Bridegroom who commands his
servants to
go out and invite all to the wedding . They return saying that the people
were too busy to come. Then he tells the servants to go out into the
highways and invite the strangers to the wedding. One person shows up
without a wedding garment. The
Bridegroom commands that he be cast out.
Paul reminds us that God is not willing that any should perish .
Many of us are called to His Kingdom , but because of our unbelief, we are
satisfied only with
knowing about God , rather tha n really knowing Him as an intimate Friend .
Only
those who continually dig into His Word and become intimately acquainted
with
His Unconditional Love for us, are the chosen ones.
Again in Heb . 6 : 1 -3 we are told to leave such things as the laying
on of hands ,
th e second coming , and even of salvation , but to g o o n into full
maturity. We all like to thing of ourselves as mature, but in 1 John 2
we are warned against being babes or
youth , but to become Fathers, knowing the authority of God in our lives
so we can
reproduce the Life of Christ in others. Babes or youth cannot do that
because of
lack of experience and m aturity.
In the Book of Genesis we read how Adam disobeyed God and in his
sha me, he
hid himself from God. That sha m e was so great that Adam and Eve took
refuge
behind a covering of fig leaves . , That was the day that Religion was
born: Religion
means man seeking after God. Christianity means God seeking after man.
In that
separation , man has forever since considered God "up there" and man "down
here".
Deeper Life is discovering that we were created to contain God. Jesus
said the
Kingdom of Heaven is Within you . 1 Cor. 3 : 1 6 says "Do you not know that
your bodies
are the Temple of God, and that J esus Christ dwells in you?" Jesus died
for us in
order to live in 1 1s. R eligion puts that all off until some future date
when Heaven comec1. Religion continues the lie of man's separation from
God. But true Christianity brings us glorious peace and rest because now
God is actually
"tabernacling" :1mon1Jst His Saints ! Our long search is over!

really cannot easily desaibe
who was doing the singing, but it
was so moving that I tried to write
down the words as best I could.
Here they are :
It is because You have cared for
me,
that I know what love is.
It is because I have come to
know Your Peace, that I would
now ; Yours only be.
It is because I have come to love
you, that I now know who I am.
. . . . and that You have made a
world for me.
. . . . and all else desired, put aside.
I came to you uncertain,
confused , and untrue,

and now there is only the simple
love of You
for i1 Your Prescence, I find such
happiness,

That I have come to sing these

From N E-Your new CHR ISTIAN LOV ELETTER was interestilg, wll done, � professional. Your
message of THE LOV E OF GOD cane thrQU!j, loud and clear. but it seemed tame in comparison to
some of the "fire and brimstone " of the past. Is it just my imagination ? -Nope, the longer I study the love
of God the more I see how He loves those church members. They may reject us but God doesn't reject them.
God loves them with the same love He loves us. The Bible says we should pray for our enemy .. However they are
not our "enemy.· They are just disillusioned about us so let's pray for their eventual understanding. Diane Zahn
and Rachel Miller are working towards that end so let's pray for the success of their mission.
From TX- You are doing such a grand job with LOVE LETTER. There is such a need in the
Community for your work.

And now, this gem .

Dea r Lee :
I don 't know if you re member me or not, but we met at the Texas Tea
Party back in 1 9 8 9 , at least I think it was 8 9 . Anyway, we sat and talked
seve ral times about the Lord a nd what He meant to each of us, a nd our
mutu a l desire to l ive as wome n . After our talks, I re membe r thinking for
the first ti me that maybe I could have my re lationshi p with Jesus a nd
still be TG without feel i ng as if I was deep i n si n , heading for hel l as all
my brothers and siste rs wou ld have me bel ieve . It was a wonderful
reve lation , but I was stil l not a ble to rece ive it for fea r you we re wrong
a nd eve ryone else I knew was rig ht. Nevertheless, I bega n rece iving you r
newslette rs and the n you r Love Lette rs with great joy a n d a nticipation. I t
seemed that whe neve r I wou ld rece ive someth ing from you it would
g reatly affect me in a positive ma nner, or it wou ld say something helpful
a bo ut what I was going through at that particular time in my l ife . It was
a lmost u nca nny. Consequently, I began to look forward to your mailings to
read and re read a nd to think a bout what you had to say concerning the Lord
a nd your consta nt preaching a bout the non-issue of cross-d ressing .
Now over the yea rs I've been up and down i n my relationshi p with our
Lord Jesus Christ, but the sad truth is, mostly, I've been down. Pushed
down by my thoughts of not being a good e nough Christia n, or a fa ithful
Christian because I was TG , a nd even, shudder, maybe TS. Well, I've been
thin ki ng about what you've bee n saying for many years, a nd fighting with
my inner thoughts for j ust as long, but now I've come to the concl usion
that I be l ieve you ' re right a bout God not caring whether we cross-dress or
not. He only cares a bout what's inside our hearts, a nd I've come to this
conclusion j ust recently, and, if you don ' t mind, I ' d like to sha re this l ittle
story with you to help expla i n my new revelation.

Once u pon a ti me (yes , I know, but j ust bear with me) . Anyway, once
upon a time the re was this pla i n looking TG person whose name was Layla.
Now Layla had given her life to the Lord , but was troubled beca use she
was a woman who very much could pass as a man a nd had done so for many
· years. Now th is poor woman had been told by all her teache rs, a nd
everyone she had confided in, that God wou ld not a nd could not tole rate
her trying to live as a woman because she passed so we ll as a ma n. This
g reatly distressed Layla, but she wa nted to do the right thi ng, so she tried
to be a fa ithfu l Ch risti a n man working at having a good re lationship with
he r Lord , but a l l the while be ing mise rable because she wasn ' t l iving as a
woman. Time passed, and Layla soon discovered she was becoming quite
wea ry of being miserable not living as a woman, so she reasoned that ·
sure ly she would beg in feeiing better if only she sta rted living as woma n .
However, after a pe riod o f time l iving as a woma n a nd bel ieving s h e was
now sinning, she began to forgo her bib le reading, prayers, and church
attenda nce, with the net result that he r relationship with her Lord
plummeted, and she fou nd herse lf once aga i n mise ra ble. This went o n for
a while, a nd the n Layla again decided she couldn't continue to l ive without _
her Lord, so she confessed her sin of cross-dressing, bega n reading her
bible, praying, and attending church reg ularly, and, low a nd behold, her
relationship with her Lord bega n to blossom agai n. This contin ues for
seve ra l years (twe nty four to be exact) until one day, afte r l iving for a
long pe riod of time without a satisfying relationsh i p with Jesus, and
being so mise ra ble she was fi nding it difficult convincing herself she
would eve r be happy again, Layla decided to give up on trying to l ive as a
woma n, again, confess her sin of cross-dressing , aga i n , a nd decide to
retrieve her re lationsh i p with the Holy Spirit aga i n . Howeve r, she knew
by this time that it would only be a matte r of a few months before she
wou ld once again be miserable at trying to live as a ma n, and this caused
her to think, "What's the usel I might as wel l die now a nd get it over

with . "

But, she q uickly put that out of he r mind because first of all, she wasn 't
too kee n o n dyi ng, a nd second of a l l, she knew it would be l i ke j u mping o ut
of the frying pan a nd into the fire . For L�yla wasn't stupid. She was just
s l ow .
As a resu lt, Layla began to think very hard at what to do. She thought
and thought and thought, and fina l ly decided she was pretty .a ngry at God
for putting her i n this mess and j ust leaving her without any hope . " If this
is a joke , " she contin ued thinking. " It 's not funny anymore . "

Even so, Layla knew that God was not trying to be funny, nor would He
leave her without hope . Something else must be wrong , but s he j ust
cou ldn ' t figu re it out. One day, as she was feeling ve ry sorry for herse lf,
which she was very good at (she a lways prided herse lf in doing things
�-- �Begafl to think a bout what she was going to do with the rest of
her life. " If I could j ust get by the next thirty or so odd yea rs that I might
have left l iving as a ma n and having a rel ationshi p with my Lord, I might
be a ble to endure th is l ife. I mea n , rea lly, look at people in prison with
long sentences. If they can exist in prison, surely I can do the time easily
in the comfort of my home , " she reasoned.
Yet, she knew deep i nside he r she was j ust fooling herse lf aga in. B ut
wait, from out of the blue a new thought slowly made its way into her
consciousness. (At this point the · reader should pictu re Layla walking i nto
a brick wall at night with her eyes closed) "Gosh, why don ' t I j ust read my
bible , pray, and atte nd church as a woman? I mea n , what harm could it
possi bly do? I ' m already being bashed by my fea rs now. It couldn' t
possi bly be a ny worse . u And bei ng awe struck by this new a nd wonderfu l
thought, she decided to put her idea to the test. The very next day,
a lthough being a bit nervous wondering what ha mme r blow mig ht strike
her, she bega n reading her bible a nd praying . She mainta inted this
reg ularly for seve ra l days, a nd immediate ly Layla began to fee l as if God
was speaking to her in a decisive way as she contin ued readi ng a nd
praying. The n it was Sunday. She had decided a nd pla n ned whe re she
· would atte nd ch u rc h that morning. It would be a large church, with lots of
people in which she cou ld easily blend in with the rest of the worshipe rs
a nd hopefully not be noticed. Turn i ng off the alarm , Layla quickly
showe red , put on her favorite outfit, fixed her ha ir, put on her face , found
her coat, and headed , somewhat nervously, for church. Arriving, she fou nd
a parking place for he r car, gra bbed her purse , opened the car door, and
marched ( i n a fe minine s r of way) towa rd the front door. I nside she
found a se at and sat down at the same time praying for strength a nd
protection in this stra nge new place . Soon the church orga n began to play,
the worshipers beg a n to sing, a nd then the ministe r bega n to preach.
Before long Layla found herse lf once agai n touched by the Spirit of God
which she had missed for so long, and re me mbering the peace of God that
passes a l l u ndersta nding. She was actu a l ly reading the bible, liste n i ng to
the Word of God bei ng pre ac hed, sing i ng hymns, fee ling the prese nce of her

Solitude
HERE ARE 1WO kinds of solitude. There is an

outward solitude when one simply does not speak,
or speaks little. There is also an inner solitude. Inner

so �itude means forgetting about everything around you,
bemg detached from it, surrendering all purpose and
desire and thought and will, and then coming before the
Lord.
This is true solitude. You will find it to be a sweet rest
and an inw� rd serenity . . . found in the arms of your Lord.
F� r that behever who ,s able to stay in such a place beforP.
his Lord there will be a great number of discoveries.
For the believer who comes this far there is the discov­
ery tha t the Lord converses and communicates with the
believ�r in his inward parts. It is in that place the Lord fills
_
the beh �ver with Himself . . . but fills him only because that
person 1s ert: pty; He clothes him with light and with love
be:ause he 1s �aked, lifts him up because he is lowly, and
_
unites him with God and transforms him, because he is
alone.
I see this solitude with God as a figure of eternal bliss­
.
a picture of that future time when the eternal Father will be
o
forever beheld.

I have a real burden on my heart

d •t has
ent itled , "Tr ansgen dered Want Eq::li " to do wit h you r "Ne ws of In terest" article
:y,

I'� quite sure you are n?t in favo r of any " equ ality" for Tran

sge ndered peo ple. I 'm
quite su �e that you consider Tran vestites and Tran
ssex uals to be the scum of the
�
earth , with no chan ce of rede mpti on unle ss they give
up what you wou ld call foul and
_
evil ways .
I am also quite sure you have neve r met a real transg ende red
perso n and that your
knowled ge of transg ender ed people comes from the Jerry Spring er Show.
I 'm sure
you have done extens ive research on the tens of thousa nds of pornog raphic sites
on
t � e Internet. I n your eyes the transg endered and transse xual are all homosexual
or so
sick no one should get near them . Sexual perverts! Best shoot them or lock them up
somewh er� . Of course, if they weren 't tools of satan , they would have a chance. If
they could Just put Jesus in their heart and accept His salvation . It would SOLVE their
and all would lead normal lives, forgiven by all true Christians for
their past deeds.

genoer problem

Does that pretty well sum things up! I 'll bet it does. It's SO EASY to know all the
answers when you don 't ask any questions. It's SO EASY to know the answers when
Y.QU don't have the problem . It is SO EASY to condemn someone to hell because
they aren 't like you and don 't have your kind of problems. It is SO EASY to avoid any
attempt at understanding because then you can be secure in your lack of Knowledge,
and can pretend to be such an EXPERT on something you just do NOT want to know
anything about.
The group of people you really like to ridicule - true transsexuals and crossdressers.
You don't know anythi ng about these people. You have already decided they are
"weirdos and have to be supressed and rejected . In your eyes, none are real
Christians - at best they might have been deluded into thi nking they are Christians.
True tranvestites (crossdressers) are almost always MAR R I ED HETEROSEXU/\LS
and have children and want nothing more than to be rid of their problem . They spend
most of their LIVES trying to hide their problem from everyone around them . They
spend their lives denying it. It causes g reat Spi ritual and psychological diustress.
Some turn to alcohol or Prozac. Many to counsellors and therapy. They don 't
understand why they have such a strong NEED to crossdress , but it's there and they
will live or die with it. NO ONE HAS EVER FOUN D A CUR E FOR CROSSDRESSING.
If I had a pill to cure it, I would sell them for $ 1 0,000 each and would be a millionaire
in just a few months.
And, you know something? Som e of these evil ( in your eyes) married heterosexual

,�

crossdressers are Christians, and some go to the Baptist Church ! Some are deacons .
in their Churches. I 'll bet you never knew SAT AN has such a hold on some Church
Leaders! ! And, of course, you claim being a transvestite is TOTALLY a choice, and
only SATAN would ever "turn " a devoted Christian to such an evil way.
TRANSS EXUALS :
Transsexuals fight their condition until they get to the point where they know they
cannot win . Some try suicide. I have a friend who tried to jump out of his helicopter
without a parachute. His Seargant managed to grab his harness on his way out the
door. Later he learned to slit h is wrists but he was unlucky enoug h to fall on his arm
and stop the blood . They kicked him out of the army due to his three attem pted
suicides.
Another friend was a chief engineer in the Airforce Rocket Program . He sat in a chair
for 5 days with a loaded gun in l1is hand trying to decide if he should pull the trigger.
Thankfully, he decided not to die.
We have had 2 suicides in my local Therapy Group. People who decided they
couldn 't deal with their transsexual problem so, I suppose, you feel such deaths
sim ply make the world a more Christian place. More suitable for young children and
virtuous m en and women. So it really makes the world a m uch better place.
Although I have found individuals in M inistries like Focus On The Family, Family
Research Counsel, who have made attempts to u nderstand , or who m ight actually
know what we are. No one has ever been able to stop the untruths that are published
about us.
The ironic thing is that the gays of the Human Rights Council (HRC) don 't like us
either. (no loss to me-ed . ) The HRC has, for years, rejected transgendered people.
The biggest transphobic gay of all is Barney Frank -- who absolutly refuses to add
transgendered people to the Employment Non-Discrimination act. It's a VER Y BAD
BI LL, and I hope it never gets passed .
So it's good to be rejected out of hand by you , American Family Association, and,
FOF. Blue Ridge Ministries, Alliance Defense Fund and others. That puts you and
these other organizations right in line with the policies of people like HRC and Frank.
At least you know what kind of com pany you are keeping.

Spiritual Maxims
A collection of timeless Christian wisdom and advice
JOHN OF THE CROSS ( 1 542- 1 59 1 ) was a
Spanish friar, theologian, poet, and religious
reformer. He is perhaps best known for the
haunting beauty of his poem and commentary
entitled The Dark Night of the Soul (1 58284) . These spiritual gems come from his collec­
tions Sayings of Light and Love, Maxims on
Love, Degrees of Perfec tion, and Other
Counsels, which he jotted down over many
years for the sake of those who sought his advice
for Christian living.

I

t is better to be burdened and in
company with the s trong than
to be unburdened and with the
weak . When you are b u rdened you are
close to God, your strength, who abides
with the afflicted. When you are relieved of
the burden, [ however, ] you are close to
yourself, your own weakness; for virtue and
strength of soul grow and are confirmed in
the trials of patience.
+ God desires [even] the least degree of obedience and sub­
missiveness more than all those services you think of rendering
Him.
+ God is more pleased by one work , however small , done
secretly, without desire that it be known, than a thousand done
with desire that men know of them. The person who works for
God with purest love not only cares nothing about whether men
see him, but doesn't even seek that God Himself know of them.
Such a person would not cease to render God the same services,
with the same joy and purity of love, even if God were never to
know of them.
+ He who does not allow his appetites to carry him away will
soar in his spirit as swiftly as a bird that lacks no feathers.
+ Well and good if all things change, Lord God, provided we are
rooted in You.
+ My spirit has become dry because it forgets to feed on You.
+ Lord, my God, You are not a stranger to h.i.m who does nor
estrange himself from You. How do they say that it is You who
absent Yourself?
+ The soul that journeys to God, but does not shake off its cares
and quiet its appetites, is like one who drags a cart uphill.
+ Think not chat pleasing God lies so much in doing a great
deal as in doing it with good will, without possessiveness and .
[regard to] human respect. ·
+ Do not think that, because the virtues you have in mind do
not shine in your neighbor, he will not be precious in God's sight .
for something of which you are not thinking.
+ See that you are not suddenly saddened by the adversities of
this world, for you do not know the good they bring, being
ordained in the judgments of God for the everlasting joy of
the elect.

♦. What does it profit you to give God one ·
thing if He asks of you another? Consider
what it is God wants, and then do it. You
will as a result better satisfy your heart than
with that toward which you yourself are

inclined.
♦ S ince , when the _ hour of r e c koning
comes, you will be sorry for not having used
this time in the service of God, why not
arrange and use it now as you would wish to
have done were you dying?
♦ Preserve a habitual remembrance of
eternal life, recalling that those who hold
themselves the lowest and the poorest and
least of all will enjoy the highest dominion
and glory in God.
♦ Rejoice habitually in God, who is your
salvation, and reflect that it is good to suffer
in any way for Him who is good.

seeks not the glory of Christ.

♦ It is a serious evil to have more regard for God's blessings

♦ Do not excuse yourself or refuse to be corrected· by all; listen
to every reproof with a serene countenance; think that God
utters it.
+ Never give up prayer; and should you find dryness and diffi­
culty, persevere in it for this very reason. God often_ desires to
see. what love your soul has, and love is not tried by ease and
satisfaction.
+ Remember always that everything that happens to you ,
whether prosperous o r adverse, comes from God, so that you
neither become puffed up in prosperity nor discouraged in

adversity.
♦ Remember always that you came here for no other reason .
than to be a saint; thus let nothing reign in your soul which does
not lead you to sanctity.
♦ He is meek who knows how to suffer his neighbor and himsel£
♦ Whoever flees prayer flees aU �hat is good.

Dear Sisters and Brothers,
I have had so much to be published that I have had to make this a 1 6 page issue.
want to thank all who have contributed material I have published herein and to those
who submitted articles for consideration. I 'll use some in the next issue.
The companion peice, " Play It As It Lays: by my dear friend, Dr. Rebecca Anne
Allison-or- Dr. Becky as most of us know her, has shed more light on our creation
before we were born. I labored on this subject and am surprised with what, by the
grace of God, I was able to come up with. As I was proof reading my article I had two
thoughts. Weird. X-file material ! ! \ , but that's thru human eyes. But through Spiritual
eyes we see God revealing His inexhaustable love of us, His created beings.
Dr. Becky came to Jackson last week and we had a wonderful evening of Dinner and
a movie right here in my home. We watched "The Apostle" , a truly great movie. Becky
came back Saturday afternoon for two hours of great Christian fellowship and then off
to Phoenix again. Becky is very dear to me. God put us together in Jan. 1992. For a
revealation, visit her at: www.drbecky.com
My health is holding well. I have had no relapses. I can work 2-3 hours a day in my
"livingroom - bedroom - office." I am requiring more blood thinner but that's no big
deal . I feel fine and hope to get another issue of LL out by the end of May.
By all means read Layla's account of her life in the past 10 years. Revealing! My dear
friend, Earle Davis has an article explaining The Deeper Life. We all should apply it
to our life. In God's time in 1968 Earle came along and threw me a lifeline as I was
floundering in my Spiritual life at that time. I was sick of the legalism of
fundamentalism and Earle pointed out in the bible where" . . . . the Law killeth but the
(Holy) Spirit giveth LI FE ! !" That nite in 1 968 my entire life in Christ was changed from
something hard to bear to freedom in Christ.
Enjoy this issue of Love Letter and drop me a line if you have the opportunity to do so.
My snail address and email address is below. No one likes to deal in negatives but if
LL is not your cup of tea. notify m,3 and I will, gracoful ly without comment, rer.·mve your
name from the mailing list and by the same token you have someone you wou ld like
to re,-ceive LL, send their mailing name and address and I'll send a copy right out to
them.
God loves us all so let's rejoice in His love for us and pass it along to others. I , also,
love you and if you need personal prayer let me know and I 'll add your name to my
5 :30 AM prayer session.
My Christian love to you,
