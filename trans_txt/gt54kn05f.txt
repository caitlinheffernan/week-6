THAT I HAVE BEEN HAVING RECENTLY• QR, WHATEVER UNTOWARD EVENT OR EVENTS
OR HAPPENINGS OR SERIES OF REVERSES MUST BE Goo's PUNISHMENT FOR BEING A
CROSSDRESSER. THIS THINKING IS THE RESULT OF THE CHURCH'S BRAINWASHING
WHICH ts AKIN TO HOGWASH. I SPENT FROM 1947, THE YEAR THAT I SURRENDERED
TO CHRIST1 UNTIL 1987 IN THIS TYPE OF THINKING. GIVING MY LIFE TO JESUS
CHRIST IN RECOGNITION OF MY OWN SINS AND EMBRACING THE FACT OF Hrs ATONEMENT FOR SIN AND GIVING HIM ENTRANCE INTO MY LIFE ONLY SERVED TO COMPLICATE THINGS WHEN THE FIRST EUPHORIA DIED DOWN IN A FEW MONTHS.
Now THE
CHURCH WAS TELLING ME HOW TO LIVE1 WHAT TO DO AND WHAT NOT TO DO. WHERE
I COULD GOl CHURCH SOCIAL FUNCTIONS, CONCERTS IN THE PARK1CHRISTIAN
MOVIES SHOWN IN THE CHURCH. ETC. WHAT I COULD NOT DO AND WHERE ! COULD
NOT GO AND THE SKY IS THE LIMIT ON THAT ONE. HELL• 1 DIDN'T NEED A BIBLE
WITH ALL OF THAT PULPIT WISDOM AND THE CHURCH BOOK OF DISCIPLINE. So I
THREW MYSELF INTO A PINK TIZZY SPIRITUALLY FOR THE NEXT JS YEARS. THE
BEAUTIFUL FACT IS THAT I AM A SURVIVOR AND THAT ONLY BY THE GRACE OF Goo!
WHEN I SEE THE HORRENDOUS GUILT TRIP CROSSDRESSING PUT ME ON1 I WONDER
HOW I DID MAKE IT THRU.
IN ALL OF THE GUILT1 Goo SET ME IN THE POSITION
OF A HOME MISSIONARY AS SUPERINTENDENT OFA SKID-ROW MISSION IN THE NORTH
EAST. AMAZING GRACE! I HAD LEFT THE CHURCH LONG BEFORE THAT AND HAD NO
CHURCH MEMBERSHIP WHICH WAS ALWAYS A REQUSITE FOR A POSITION SUCH AS THAT.
Ir's A LONG· LONG STORY OF HOW I WAS SELECTED. I DID NOT APPLY FOR THE
POSITION. BOTTOM LINE IS THAT Goo GAVE IT TO ME ANO KEPT ME IN IT FOR
19 YEARS DURING WHICH I WAS A CLOSET CD AND ONLY THE THREE OF US KNEW.
MYSELF, MY WIFE AND Goo. IN SPITE OF IT ALL· I WAS IN NO WAY COMFORTABLE
WITH MY CROSSORESSING.
IN THOSE YEARS I ASKED Goo MANY TIMES TO "DELIVER"
ME FROM IT SO THAT I COULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE. HE DIDN'T DO IT. PERIO~.
Now I KNOW THAT HE DIDN'T NEED TO. I SEE THE MIRACLE OF Hrs GUIDING HAND
IN ALL OF IT. CROSSDRESSING DIDN'T MEAN A THING TO HIM. THAT WAS NOT
THE ISSUE WITH HIM.
Now I KNOW HOW MUCH HE BLESSED THE FAITH THAT EROUGHT
M~ TO Hrs FEET TO ASK DELIVERANCE. WITH ME· CROSSDRESSING WAS THE ISSUE.
WITH HIM· FAITH IS THE ISSUE.
IT WAS THE FAITH THAT HE GAVE ME THAT CA~­
RI ED ME AND THAT'S WHY THE DEVIL COULDN'T USE CROSSDRESSING TO DESTROY ME
WHICH COULD'VE HAPPENED HAD I SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER BEEN EXPOSED.

I

CAN ~ow HEAR THE CRY OF1 "ABOMINABLE THINKING!" To SAY THAT Goo ALLOWS

Some Theological Thoughts
by

Frances Fairfax
One thing I find very disturbing about the crossgender community is the attitude among many that
1udeo-Ouistian morality is somehow inimical to the
crossdresser. There is a real hostility to the very idea of
moral absolutes, and to the idea of a God who holds each
person accountable for his or her actions. The act of
crossdressing creates in many a tremendous burden of
guilt and shame, generated in great pan by a narrow,
legalistic religious system drummed into them in
childhood and reinforced by ignorance and stereotyping
in certain quarters today. Deep down inside, the
crossdresser knows that his feminine traits are an essential
part of his total personality, and as such are a gift of God
and not to be suppressed and denied expression. However.
in rejecting prohibitions against crossdressing some end
up rejecting the whole concept of absolute moral values
and become scornful of those who venture to uphold
such values. What follows are my own insights on
religion and the c~r. I write in hopes of dispelling
some of the destructive stereotyping on.the part of both
religious "authorities" and anti-religious-;;rossdressers.
The most often quoted religious injunction against
crossdressing is. of course, the infamous Deuteronomy
22:5, which reads (in the King James translation), .. A
woman shall not put on that which penaineth unto a man.
Neither shall a man put on a woman's garment; for
whomsoever doe:h these things is an abomination unto
Jehovah. thy God" This passage occurs as part of a
"laundry list" of other regulations and prof:iibited
behaviors. (Curiously enough. crossdressing as such is
mentioned nowhere else in Scripture.) To understand
and deal with this passage it must be considered in its
proper context.
The passage leaves no doubt that for the Jews.
crossdressing was forbidden. There was a very serious
religious-moral re:ison_ for this. one which is seldom
mentioned in crossdressing literature. The whole purpose
of all the elaborate Mosaic laws was to maintain the
separate identity of the Jews as a special people. set apart
and consecrated to God. an example to the world The
Jews were about to enter their Promised Land. a land
already inhabited by peoples whose religions can best be
described :is fenility cults. Their worship involved male
and female ritual prostitution. as the people sought
sexual union with their gods and goddesses. These
rituals also induded crossdressing, with the men appearing

as women and the women wearing men's clothes and
weapons. Young male devotees would castrate
themselves and thereafter wear women's clothing and
serve at the shrines. It was to keep the Jews away from
any semblance of this that God through Moses prohibited
crossdressing.
The imponant thing to remember about
Deuteronomy 22:S, however. is that the injunction against
crossdressing, like those against eating pork, mixing
meat and milk. and all the rest. were for the Jews ~
~- Obeying those laws kept the Jews separate from
pagan contamination but did not ~ them. since no one
could really obey them all. Wben Jesus came He fulfilled
all the requirements of the Law. then replaced it with His
new covenant of love. So the answer for people twiil
who invoke Deuteronomy 22:S against crossdressing is
that Jesus has set us free from that law just as He no
longer requires us to abstain from pork. If we had to keep
all those laws in order to be saved. then Christ came and
died for nothing. So says no less an authority than St
Paul. This is the most effective answer to the invokers of
Deuteronomy 22:S, and one that is most difficult for the
judgmental to counter.
Another argument used against crossdressing by
some preachers is based on a New Testament passage. I
Corinthians 6:9. This states in part that "neither
fornicators. nor idolators. nor adulterers, nor effeminate,
nor abusers of themselves with mankind" shall inherit
the kingdom of God. This language is from the King
James Version. very much revered. and still used
extensively by Protestants. The traditional Roman
Catholic translation also uses the tenn "the effeminate..,
followed by "sodomites". What a we:ipon that one tenn
..the effeminate" is in the hands of preachers who apply
it to crossdressers and then link it to the term meaning
"homosexuals" that follows it! However. the term
formerly translated ..the effeminate" actually refers to
the ritual male prostitutes who were very much a feature
of cultic worship in the Greek society St. Paul was
addressing. One of the most widely used mqdem
translations among Protestant churches today is the New
International Version. and it renders the same passage as
"nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders". The
Living Bible settles for the single word "homosexuals"
and the New American Bible (Roman Catholic) uses
••sexual pervens".

MIRROR IMAGE
By Rebecca Anne Allison
Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the
interests of others. -- Philippians 2:4
Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice
behind you, saying, "This is the way. Walk in it.." -- Isaiah 30:21
A few summers ago, my family went visiting friends in another town
and I was alone for a long weekend. I decided I had been the "lone ranger"
long enough; it was time to find other crossdressers. (As some astronomers
feel about extraterrestrial life: I knew they were out there, but I didn't
know how to make contact.)
New Orleans was a short drive away. My plan was to shop and stroll
the mall en femme, then start making telephorle calls (yellow pages?) to
find the CD clubs. In retrospect, I did not realize the difficulty and
danger I might have faced at night in the French Quarter alone. The Lord
had an interesting way of protecting me.
I checked into the hotel and took my time with the transformation.
The dress and the wig were new - and just right. Finally I was ready. As
I smiled at the lady in the mirror, I thought, "This is the best i t has
ever been."
No one gave any indication of reading me as I walked to my car and
drove to the mall. I shopped both department stores, too nervous to actually try on or buy, but savoring the time in public. "This is easier than
I expected," I told myself as I walked back to my car.·
I left the mall and decided to "cruise" for a while before returning
to the hotel for my phone calls. At the first traffic light, I looked into
the rearview mirror to check my wig and makeup. I rearranged my bangs,
thinking how wonderful it felt to have hair on my forehead again, and didn't
notice my foot relax on the brake.
Crunch.
I would never have believed a rear end collision at five miles an hour
could do such damage. No one was hurt, thank the Lord; but the car in front
of me had broken taillights and a dented trunk. My car would not move. I
sat still, soaked in a cold sweat, as the radiator fluid ran into the street.
"I am dead," I thought to myself. "Life is over. I'll be on the front page
tomorrow." Would I be taken to the New Orleans jail in a dress?
To my relief, the policeman was not even surprised (this was New Orleans, after all), and the only other person to know the whole story was the
tow truck operator who carried me back to my hotel. I was still in a panic.
I purged everything in the hotel garbage can and rented a car to go back home.
Of course, the story was not in the newspapers. My insurance agent finally
forgave me. I swore off crossdressing forever (it lasted six months) and
tried to devise a believable story to explain the absence of the car.

)o

--The experience left me with one major take-home lesson:
"There is a time to look in the mirror, and there is a time to
keep your eyes on the road."
Someone else who had problems from looking at his own reflection was
Narcissus. Greek mythology tells us this youth incurred the anger of the
gods, who caused him to fall in love with his own image as reflected in a
pond. He could not stop gazing at this lovely image, and so he wasted away,
longing for a love he could not have. From him we have the term "narcissism",
which describes an unusual degree of self interest." Narcissism has assumed
a negative connotation for most persons. Actually, some degree of narcissism is healthy and promotes self-respect. This is especially true for the
crossdresser, as we try to present as attractive a feminine appearance as
possible. We are perfectly right to give priority to our own needs. But
what is the proper balance between serving ourselves and serving others?
I am not referring here to service to others on a public level. As a
Christian, I want to give time in volunteer sePv'ice to charitable organizations. Through my church I also give my time and money to aid the needy.
God's love to us - and through us - causes us to ~erve willingly.
My question of self service versus self sacrifice is on a more personal
level. Once I have met the demands of my work; once I have enjoyed time with
friends and family - especially my spouse; once I have shared with others is there anything left for me? Now we see how selfishness and self-denial
have relevance in our special lives.
On the one hand, if I were unrestrained by the needs of others, I could
enjoy "being Rebecca" far more often. I would spare no expense to enhance·
my femininity. My calendar would be cleared for every national event as well
as local meetings and social time. It's a wonderful daydream ... But what
harm I would cause! My loved ones would be neglected; my marriage damaged
beyond repair. My professional activity might be seriously compromised.
Clearly, for me at least, such a degree of self-indulgence is too much.
But I may overcompensate in my attempt to please others. When I deny,
or totally suppress, my feminine qualities, I become unlike the person God
created me o be. Consequences follow in a predictable pattern. I cannot
will mysel_ ~ot to think about crossdressing. The longer I deny it, the more
it dominate~ my thoughts, producing distraction and irritability. I have
created the environment of conflict I tried to avoid. Too much "self-sacrifice" is harmful. I owe it to myself to consider my own special needs.
God has given us ways to find balance in our lives. First, we have
Jesus's commandment to love one another. It is this love for others which
causes us to modify our behavior. A word of caution is needed here: it is
possible to practice self-denial for reasons other than love. We may be
seeking to alter or control our spouse's feelings about ourselves and our
crossdressing. Maybe our need for her approval motivates us. Perhaps our
self image is so poor, we feel undeserving of our own wishes. If we "love
our neighbor as ourselves", our healthy self-respect will let us meet our
own needs and still be considerate of others.

\

The second way we find balance is by seeking the guidance of the Holy
Spirit. We have God's promise to guide us in our daily walk, if we remain
responsive to his leading. There is no fixed formula. The right amount of
self :cestraint for me may be too much for you. Furthermore, God will not
show us the "big picture" - he will not spread out before us his plan for the
totality of our life. He only gives us enough enlightenment for our present
circumstances. He wants us to seek his will daily - and he will not reveal
himself further until we follow the leading he has already given. If our
attitude is "God, show me your will, and I'll think about it," our prayers
will not be heard.
Balance is hard to find and easy to lose. In the months since I
shared all my secrets with my wife, I have fallen off the path on both
sides. I pushed too fast for acceptance, then retreated too deeply, trying
for damage control. Now I am trying to "rest in the Lord, and wait patiently
for him." We are learning to negotiate and compromise so both of us will
consider the needs of the other. We want a co~promise based on love, not on
a desire to control. I don't ask for any long range plans. As God leads me
one day at a time, he sometimes includes some very pleasant surprises. There
are even times to relax and enjoy the view - in tne mirror!

~co~o@...-u~o+o~~o·o~
Girls if we are to have any semblance of what God's plan
is for us I think the first thing we must do is look upon our
crossdressing as a tool used by God and our girl within to
bring out and develop our femside.
What is femininity? Ladies Home Journal once asked that
question of it's readers and got about as many answers as_ it
did responses.
We each have our own idea of what fem1n1n1ty
means.
To me it means gentleness, it means being
compassionate and concerned, it means being loving and
carinq.
For me crossdressing is simply a tool used by God
and m; girl within to bring out and develop tho~e.
.
characteristics.
As they are developed the fem1n1ne remains
even while I am in the masculine form.
Girls if we are to stop the feelings of guilt we must do
as we ask God to do, look past the clothing, look into the
heart and ~PF wh~t is really there.
Perhaps then we will
begin to see what God"s wonderful plan is for us, and begin
to understand how crossdressing is a part of that wonderful
plan.
When we see the heart, when we see j~s~ what .
.
femininity really is, when we allow the fem1n1ne to interJect
with the masculine to help create a better person out of us~
then we will rid ourselves of the guilt, and we will r~place
it with great pride in God's wonderful plan fo~ us~
Like me
girls. you will recognize that your crossdress1ng l~ a .
wonderful gift from God, and you will take great_ pride in the
fact that he choose YOU to give that wonderful gift to.

FOCUS
by

Jaye
Where is your focus in life? What is most important in life to you? What is it about which you spend the most time
thinking? What is it you want do do most of the time? All of these questions bear on the issue of focus. They define the
focus of your life; they define the focus of my life. Whatever is most important to me is what will dominate my attention;
whatever is most important to me is thus the focus of my life. Whatever it is about which I spend the most of my time
thinking defines where my life is focused. What ever it is about which I spend the most of my time thinking is what is
most important to me and is the basis of my life focus. Whatever it is I do most of the time tells me what it is I'm thinking
about and what forms the focus of my life.
Before we go off on a tangent defending what we do for a living, the church we attend, or even defending
crossdressing, let us look a little beneath the surface. Lets say you are a professional. Lets say you have a career which
demands a huge amount of your time and you spend a lot of time thinking about this career and what you are doing in it.
Lets say you spend the bulk of your ti.me actually performing the actions required in your career. Is this career the focus
of your life? Could be! Maybe not too. It depends.
If we are in a given career with the career and the perquisites which come along with the career: money, status,
power, etc.; are the principal things of value to us within the career, then we can say our focus is on the career. But what
of the situation in which the career is but a means to an end: a situation by which we are able to meet our needs in a way
we can then go on with more important stuff. In such a scenario, our focus is not on our career but on thosf' things we
group under the heading: "important stuff." In such a setting we may spend 99.9% of our waking hours in pu;suit of the
career, but so long as something else occupies the status of "important stuff', our career is not our focus ... the "important
stuff" is our focus and the career is but a means to the end required by the "important stuff".

As contributing editors to Grace and Lace, we are continually faced with the issue of focus. We are human and there
are ti.mes when we flop miserably. There are times when we simply are not in tune with the Lord and when this happens,
we emit a lot of sour notes and cacaphonic noise. We really hope you dear readers are in a forgiving mood and will
recognize our human defocusing for what it is .... evidence we aren't God and we don't have a totally "clear channel" to
the Throne any more than you do. Still, even in our ineptness and defocused human failing, we hope what we are doing
in bringing this little publication to you will in some way enhance and enrich your FaithWalk with the Lord.
Toward a singularity of mind, we are aware when our focus is on the 'Lord. Jesus Christ all else is insignificant. It is
this message, if none other, we all need to hear. Often we've heard the expression: "Let Go, Let God!" How wonderfully
true and simple sounding this is. When we let go and let God we are walking in faith. When we try to manage things
ourselves in our human power, we are not walking in faith, we are trusting in ourselves. There.is no way we humans can
please God through the exercise of our human abilities. The Law shows us this conclusively. The Law requires something
which is beyond our abilities: perfection. Only Christ possessed and possesses the capacity for perfection. We humans do
not. The whole purpose of the Law was to make this point plain to us. When it becomes plain to us we lack the capacity to
achieve perfection we are then ready to begin the FaithWalk.
Why all this talk about perfection? This question serves to sharpen our focus on Christ. We talk about perfection
because only Ouist had and still has perfection. Talking about perfection focuses our attention on Christ. We must focus
endlessly on Christ for ONLY in Christ is there hope for us considering the perfection demanded by the Law and our
inability to adlieve perfection, illus our inabilit'f to comply v;ith God's Law.
Why even mention the Law if as Christians we are set free from the yoke of the Law? The answer is simple. Even
though we know in our minds what we have been taught about Christ's having paid the price for us we could never pay;
Christ's having 'bought us back' (this is what redemption means), we don't live as though we believe what our minds say
we know. We tend to fall endlessly into the trap of trying to present ourselves as "better Christians" by our overt efforts
to obey the Law as though our so doing would in some way earn "points" with God for us. When we do this, we are
taking our eyes off of the Lord, we are taking our focus off of Christ and turning our focus onto our own attempts to earn
our way into a good place with God by our own merit. We may deny we are doing this. In fact, we probably will deny
and stoutly so claiming we are not engaged in the utter futility of 'works righteousness.' Still, in spite of our denials it is
precisely what we are doing when we are not focused EXCLUSIVELY on Christ and walking in a simple child like faith
letting go and letting God.
We mention the Law because the law proclaims damnation aiming at turning us to focus on Olrist. We mention the
Law for the enemy uses the Law to weigh us down with guilt (example: those who hammer us with Deut 22:5 are serving
the enemy by trying to heap guilt on us for crossdressing) and we need to avoid the traps the enemy puts before us. The
only way we can avoid these traps is to walk in a simple child-like faith letting go, letting God ... even to the smallest of
details .... Remember, walk in a simple child like faith with a total focus on Ouist and God is faithful to take care of even
the smallest of details. This is the way out of the conundrum compounded by the Law ... Focus on Christ EXCLUSIVE; LY!

Mission refuses funds from mainly gay church
• St. Stephen's Community
Church had offered Gateway
Rescue Mission $10 a month.

"The Bible, our
textbook, teaches
against their way
of life homosexuality:"

By Charlotte Graham
Clanon-llldger ReUfJlon Writer

Gateway Rescue Mission has taken a
bold stand on what Executive Director
David Hopkins calls its "biblical princi·
pies."
The mission, founded in 1948 as a
Christ-centered response to the problem
of homelessness and poverty, has refused
to accept donations from St. Stephen's
United Community Church of America.
The reason for the refusal: The
church's primary membership are gays
md lesbians.
"~ine months ago, we received a letter
from St. Stephen's Community Church
and the letter said, 'Our church bas voted
to give Gateway Rescue Mission $10 a
month. Our church is made up primarily
of gays and lesbians. We believe you are
helping the people of our community, as
well as others.' "
After receiving the letter, Hopkins pre-"
sented it to the organization's board ofdi·
rectors. "For several months we spent
much time considering the overall situa·
tion. After much prayer and consider·
ation. the board decided that it would not
be fair to them for us to receive their funds
when the Bible is the textbook for our rehabilitation program. The Bible, our
textbook, teaches against their way of life

- David Hopkins
- homosexuality."
· The board of directors returned the $70
St. Stephen's contributed to the mission.
"Since the Bible, with clarity, teaches
that homosexuality is not only sin, but a
sin which the first chapter of Romans
teaches is wholly against God's direct
command, Gateway Rescue Mission is
careful to riot receive certain funds that
might restrict us from teaching and
preaching the whole gospel," said Hopkins.
"It is regrettable when one's biblical
principles serve to promote prejudice,
bias, bigotry and discrimination against
any group of human beings," said WU·
liam A. Flint of Jackson, general superintendent of the United Community
Church of America.
"The human factor in our countey is

principles serve to promote prejudice,
bias, bigotry and discrimination
against any group of human beings."
- William A. Flint

volatile," he said. ''The great strides f~r~
civil and human rights and justices ofthe . ·
1960s are in jeopardy of being reversed iri
the 1990s.
· f.fHopkins said Gateway's board of direc.; :tors loves homosexuals, just as it does·
other people. He said anyone is welcome
to walk through the doors of the mission.
"We provide service to anyone who'
needs it, regardless of their beliefs," he·
said. "However, we stand firm to teach·
and preach that homosexuality is a sin."
Flint said St. Stephen's has both gay
and non-gay members. He said it was the
non-gay members' decision to donate to
Gateway.
"I'm quite sure Gateway receives con·
tributions from other churches that have
gay and non-gay members," said Flint.
"When you have got your hand out asking, don't bite the hand that's feeding
you. He that is without sin, cast the first
::itone."
"Satan thought he had a victory when
Christ was crucified and he rejoiced,"
said Hopkins. "In all actuality, what Satan thought was his victory was his de·
feat.
"Likewise the enemy has tried to use
this incident with the St. Stephen's Com·
munity Church of America to hinder
God's work at Gateway Rescue Mission,"
he said. "He will soon find out, as Satan
found out. It won't be his victory, but our
victory. Gateway Rescue Mission is the
Lord's work. not ours."
