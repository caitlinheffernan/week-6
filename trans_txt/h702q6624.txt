THE PURPOSE OF GRACE AND LACE is simply to present the positive that God loves us and is on our
side in life in spite of our crossdressing. His care and concern is for our souls. We, also, are
His created beings and His love is for His Creation of which we are part of.
Whether we wear
skirts, pants or nothing at all is no issue with C�I>. The clothes humanity wears does not validate
any standing before God. Faith does. Faith in skirts, faith in pants and faith wearing nothing
at all ; faith is the only criteria for pleasing God.
But without faith it is impossible to please Him;
for he that cometh to God must believe that He is (exsists)
and that He is the rewarder of them that diligently
seek Him. (Hebrews 11 :6 KJV)
B'.f f2.ith the harlot, Rahab, perished not with them that
believed not, when she received the spies with peace.
(Heb. 11: 31)
Just one question. If God blessed a prostitutes faith, is there any reason whj_ He can't bless
Daisy the crossdressers faith? At this point I could "take off" into a 3 page dissertation.As
you can sense, I feel very strongly on the fact of God's love for us as His created beings. I'll
spare you and tell you that I love you.
I want to make G&L a bi-monthly publication in 1992 with the first issue in February. My mail
list is growing weekly in spite of the fact that there has been no letter since June. I have
adjusted my work schedule to allc.w me the �-ime I need. W:Jrk is a necessity as as the 20 years I
spent as director of a skid-row mission in NJ had no retirement benefit. I now have the time I
needed and I can see no excuse for not coming to you again in 2 months from this time.
PLEASE NOTE: I ask you to notify me if you do not wish to receive further copies of G&L. I will
not think negatively of you and will thank you now for saving me the postage and copying expense.
After all, not everyone likes vanilla ice crean1. I like chocolate myself and I have a friend who
loves pistachio. In that vein, G&L is not for everybody.
HOW IS G&L PAID FOR? I must confess that this issue has not cost me anything. Sisters have
sent donations which were unsolicited. My policy is to keep G&L free of any kind of fund solici-­
tations. Should I ever become tmable to work, that would be another story. I had a Christian Radii
program in the West Indies in the '70s and never once asked directly or indirectly for anyf Some
day I'll tell you of the miracle of God's provision. Starting out with a $109.00 reel tape record­
er and ending up with a complete professional studio in an e2,..,tra room in the Mission. I stopped
only because there were nnre and more demands on my time locally. Anyhow, PLEASE enjoy G&L and
if you need extra copies for friends, I have them and they are yours. Just ask.
No. I don't have my

There is nothing to

sights set on forming a crossdressers church. No way! The printed page and
word via cassette tapes to all of our dear sisters is it. I do envision in
having a retreat for us some weekend here in Jackson but that is in the future­
buy or join now or anytime later. Just enjoy G&L.

!Ear Friends;

A word about our Hig h Priest, Jesus Christ who was the sacrifi cial lamb
without blemis h. God
would not accept the person who offered a sacrificial animal
which had a blemish.
"That you may be acce pted, you shall offer a male
withou t blemis h of the young bulls, the sheep or the
goats .
But you shall not offer anything which has a blemish
for it will not be acceptable for you. (Lev.20: 19-20)'
*****
But you were purchased with the precious blood of
ehl!ist the Messi ah, like that of a sacrif icial lamb
without spot. (I Peter l: 19)
"Wheras this One (Christ), after He had c, ffered a single sacrifice for c.ur
sins (that shall avail)
for all time, sat down at the right hand of God." Heb. 1.0: 12. (All quotes
fr. Amplified Bible.)
Bear with me. There is a point to all of this.

+

Let us , then, hold firmly to the faith we {::rofess. For we have a great High
Friest who has gone into the very i:,rescer.ce of God-Jesus, the son of God. our
High Priest is not one who cannot feel sympathy for our weaknesses. On the con­
trary, we have a High Priest who was t.eI11=ted in every way we are, but did not
sin. Let us have confidence, then, and a pproach God's throne where there is Grace.
There we will receive n'.<:r
· cy and ftnd Grace to h.<?lJ:; us just when we need it."

The re was a fellow in Jesus ' tin�, a ptar isee , who was gcing into t he Tem�l e to

uf� Wai:: a tax c o l lect er.

In t hose days tax cc•llectors were iM�E-pender:t con t r ac t o rs . The gove r nrr e-r:1. tc,ld t hem
how n.t:ch $ they expE·cted f r om a g i\lE:.•r, area. A tax colJector wai:: ,:�-signed and tE,
was the on� w�o detern,ine d the amc��t of your tax a n d they rea lly l a i d it on ever y ­

g�the sp�cified amb�n t the govt. w an t ed fr o m his
.
t e r rit o r y . The collector was a hat ed, miser abla wor m and a poor exc u s e for a hum a n
bein g.
So there they go. Two men widely divergent in philosophy and social station in life; yet ooth
seeking the same God. The self-righteous Pharisee prayed :
"The Pharisee took his stand ostentatiously (showy display; pretentiousness)
and began to pray thus before and with himself: 'God, I thank You t.hat I am
not as the rest of men, extortioners (robbers), swindlers--unr ighteous in heart
and life--adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and
I give tithes of all that I gain."' (Luke 18: 11 & 12 Ampl. Bible)
Pity the po or tax collector listening to all of that "Holy an\I" stuff.
"But the tax collector, (merely) standing at a distance, would
not even lift up his eyes to heaven; but kept sstriking his
breast, saying, '0 God, be favorable (be gracious, be n-erciful)
to me, the especially wicked sinner that I am!.''.'
But I tell you, this man went down to his home justified- forgiven and made upright and in right standing with God- rather than thepther ·man; for everyone
who exhalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exhalted. (Luke 13 & 14 Ampl.)
There is nqsense in being Pharisee-like before God. To try to justify our CDing by saying, "well,
women wear pants and n-en's shirts and now men's boxer shorts followed up by what a good person
you are. That kind of rationalization just won't fly. It's only when we realizJ�oll sin ha s taken
on our lives and become aware we can in no way make it up to God; it is then that we can avail our­
selves of impact of the cross. God, in the person of Jesus Christ, paid the death penalty He de­
manded for sin,".
•the soul that sins shall die:' (Ezekiel 18: 4) . He paid for our sins.
we could never pay for our sins nor can we repay The Christ of God for what He ha s done for us.
In all of this I am trying to say that God takes no joy in our suffering. The satanic forces do.
As long as we believe the lie that CDing is a cardinal sin against God is just how long we will
suffer. In faith, do what the tax collector did.

So many of the perceptions people have of themselves are wrong. If they rely on thier own wis­
dom they will come up very short of what &-od really wants of them. You need to learn how to es­
cape your own wisdom, because.it isn't wisdom after all. It is more likely lies that have been
pounded into your head .
.{cm nnist learn to leave your own wisdom and begin to rely on God's
wisdom. (Day BY Day Love Is A Choice Daily Devotional.)

\Dlderstanding did not come with achievement of a Doctorate level in Theology. All that did was add
meaningless credentials and @l my head with a lat at the facts of the patent failures at hwnanlcind in ritualizing
faith. All the pursuits of Psychology to the high�t advanced levels did nothin to spea k to the spitit Within. Alt
g
Psychology did was give some theoretical understanding to the woridn&5 c:J the mS'ld,
the development and emergence
of the persona and how It interacts With the sociological milieu Neither academic pursuit spoke •Spirttua1• at

All this time, since I first learned to feel guilty for loving to dress In feminine things_. and Interestingly
enough, we all have to learn to feel guilty- the guilt is not spontaneous, as it wouJd be were

What is significant is working through an the socially dictated guilt and a:,ming to an understan

of something good I
have done or can do, but because am God's aeation.__ and this includes my need to express my
God given femininity by
means of outward attire selection
Now, man aml this was no smaJJ task. The guilt training I'd received, the
conditioning of society, and the honible experience of the dlsifiusionment with fonnaJ chn.ichiosity concomitantly

I foolishly thought the per1stroika would result in dlmtnutton of my destre to crossdress._. wrong! I was
puzzled. I had a sense I could love myself dressed Ol' not. I had a sense I was different !or ordinary folks fer a reason. I
had a sense I did not have to knO\N what that reason was. I had a sense aJI needed to do was leave the whole thing up
to the Lord. Even with a towering IQ sometimes I am not very smart_ it took me a while to figure it ouL It took me
a whi le to let go and let God, in this most intimate aspect of my life. I still don't know why I am a heterosexual male
who is more woman than man in innemost persona. I don't know why I was given such a consuming desire to study and
earn both Theology and Psychology. I don't know why all this and more. I believe it was so would have a lot of the

To the issue of the Law and Crossdressing_ we!L for me the issue ts a nolo c:cntendre. There is no contest

Jrtefiectually, the law is plain (so Is the one about eating pig meat etc, tor example), but spintuafly, the ever present
