AN EVANGELICAL CHR/$1/AN PIJBLICATION FOR THE TRAN$GENOEREO
Pomllio• Box 31253 Jaolt.1on M$ 39286- 1253.
JULY � 1995
WHY ME, LORD 1

Why did you have to make me a crossdresser? I , and most of us have asked that
question of God too many times to recall and got no answer.
st. Paul sought the Lord 3 times for deliverance • • • well, here, #to keep me
from becoming conceited there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of
satan to torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from
me but Be said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you for My power is made
perfect in weakness' # . {2 Cor. 12:7) Would you settle for an answer such as
that? #Yet O Lord, You are our Pather. We are the clay and you are the
potter, we are the work of your hand w . Isaiah said that in Isaiah 64:8. Again
St. Paul. This time in Romans 9:20-21.But who are you O man to talk back to
God? #Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, why did you make me like
this? ##Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay
some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?�Again Isaiah in
Chapter 29 verse 16,Mshall the potter be considered of no more account than
the clay? Shall the thing that is made say of it's maker, he did not make me;
or the thing tbat is formed say of him who formed it, he has no understanding?�
Is one of our Transgendered Rights the right to question God? Yes.God has
patience with us but that doesn't alter the fact of how Be made us nor will
it change that fact. We can pray for God to deliver us from how Be made us or
we can go to a Holy Spirit conference or meeting and have some sizzling
Evangelist press on our forehead and give us a Spiritual jolt but all we will
do when we get up off our knees is stand there a jolted transgenderist. A well
meaning Christian worker will then ask if you have been delivered and not
wanting to be subjected to any more, you answer, -yes # .and go on your way
wondering why God didn't deliver you from the way He made you. You may as well
ask Bim to make you s•2- and 95 lbs. thereby delivering you from yo� present
5'10" and 250 lbs.(my dimensions--Bd.).
#Aperson who believes he is a victim of life's circumstances sits pouting in
self pity, childishly asking why things(transgendered state in our case-­
Bd.)have to be this way. They ride an endless merry-go-round of, -if only
things were different # �Borrowed quote from a friend's book1 To put an end to
this merry-go-round ride we must get off of the ride and sit down and rest to
dispell the dizziness of our past thinking and self-pity.We have to start
thinking about acceptance of ourselves as God has made us. The first thing is
to realize He Actually did make us transgendered. That's the fact of the
matter.and from which there is no escape. Pace it head-on,# I am a crossdresser
or transgendered person or transsexual for the rest of my life.'' Pace itl

Part III - The Church's Response To The Crossdresser

Like many of you who read these
words, I was raised to believe that there was
a definitive and certain way to do things in
life. One acted a certain way, one dressed
and carried oneself a certain way, one
.believed a certain way, and one never, ever
was to question or alter the prescribed
conception of what one was -taught by
society's various institutions (e.g., family,
school, church, etc.). There was a code of
thought and conduct that was to be followed
at all times, and the penalty for deviating
from the established norm was usually
instantaneous social, cultural, ecclesiastical
reproof and/or reprisal. I have learn� as I
have grown older and hopefully wiser, that
quite possibly I may have been (somewhat
deliberately?) misinformed by those
aforementioned institutions concerning many,
many aspects of life in general.
I questioned my faith in God at .
various periods of my life, only to have the
evidence of God's existence and movement in
that life presented more and more clearly as
time went on. It is now quite obvious to me
and I am totally convinced that God is acting
in, and on behalf of, each of us as human
beings. We are not here by accident, and we
can know the infinite joy ora personai
relationship with our Creator through the
blood of our Redeemer, Christ Jesus. The
Holy Spirit of God can live in and through us
on a daily basis as we seek to know and
understand God, notwithstanding our finite
capacity for such understanding and
comprehension.
The love of God, extended toward
God's people, knows no boundaries either in
Heaven or on this earth. That fact has been
amply illustrated for me throughout the
circumstances of my own life, and I can
write these words secure in the knowledge of
God's all-encompassing love for and grace

toward me. It is my fervent prayer that you,
the reader, may also possess the security of
that knowledge for yourself.
The God that I know, love, and serve
does not discriminate against anyone 6 •
Therefore, a crossdresser should certainly be
able to accept God's free gift of salvation
regardless of what ·society 9r even the
institutionalized Church may try to tell
her/him. If a person should attempt to
oppress, reject, ,or ostracize a crossdresser
strictly on the basis of crossdressing
behavior, then that person has little or no
knowledge of or regard/appreciation for the
overwhelming inclusivity of God's love,
grace, and acceptance for all people on earth.
It is my contention that such a person is more
concerned with appearance, legalism, or their
own internalized bigotry and prejudice than
with the essence of Jesus Christ's Gospel that
is, by far, the most inclusive concept in the
universe.
Why would a supposedly sincere,
honest, "God-fearing" Church member
discriminate against or oppress a
crossdresser? I believe there are several
possible reasons:
• . _The internalized homophobia
_· � is rampant ,in our se}.'Uaily tepressed • ·
, culture, particularly within entrenched
institutions like the Church, creates a force
almost of its own that causes a backlash
against anyone who is considered "different"�
from a traditionally patriarchal (meaning
white Christian male) perspective this
generally includes women, children, the
economically disadvantaged, people of color,
gays/lesbians/bisexuals, the physically or
mentally disadvantaged, other ethnic groups,
6

Please see the chapter entitled lnc/usivity
for further discussion on the matter of
discrimination.

•·-

and - of course - persons who crossdress. If
you believe my thesis to be incorrect, I invite
you to spend some time visiting, talking with,
and (most importantly) listening to persons
from the above-mentioned groups. If you
take a valid sample rrom the various
demographic groups, and if your sample
populations answer honestly, you will be
amazed at the depth of conviction concerning
the reality of such systemic and
institutionalized oppression. From such a
perspective, it becomes a relatively simple
matter to see the impact of "liberation
theology" oii such populations. Liberation
theology's primary tenet is that, rather than
being neutral, God is always on the side of
the oppressed rather than the oppressor. God
is the liberator of the oppressed; ergo, the
term "liberation theology". Consequently,
oppression (in whatever form) becomes the
primary definition of "sin". The resistance of
oppression, then, becomes God's will for our
lives, and the triumph of justice over
oppression becomes God's victory over sin.
Whenever someone is freed from oppression
or subjugation, God is glorified because sin
has been overcome. In the interim, however,
we are forced to confront the very real
oppression ofthe patriarchal backlash
against those who are "different" and who are
not in positions of power - and so the
struggle continues.
• The commonly perceived threat
to the "established order" is one that many
people take very seriousiy. Cross±-essers
shake up the Church's often-preconceived
notions concerning what is and what is not
considered to be acceptable appearance.and
behavior. What people do not understand,
they tend to fear; fear breeds prejudice,
bigotry, and oppression. It jars the
consciousness of many Church members to
think that a crossdresser (one ofthose
"different" types) might enjoy the same status
before God as they. This could be considered
an example of "Christian piety" getting in the
way of true Christianity.

• The rationale most utilized by
the anti-crossdresser forces within the
Church is the Biblical passage of
Deuteronomy 22:5. The inclusion of this
verse in the Canon of Scripture has been a
thorn in the side of many a crossdresser over
the centuries. It has led to various incidents
of expulsion and/or rejection from the
Church, loss of faith by many crossdressers,
and occasionally� tragically, drastic action
(including suicide) by those who were taught
that they were immoral, sinful, or evil
because oftheir iMer need to crossdress.
Remembc:-,-Joan cf Ar� was. burned at the
stake, by agents of the Church, because she
was a crossdresser. My prayer is that every
person could have the knowledge of the
freedom that God's salvation, through Chr:ist,
from the Old Testament Law offers to all
who will accept it. It may be helpful for us to
remember that Christ Jesus took every
opportunity to state and to demonstrate that
God's grace, as expressed through
compassion, superseded the socially and
theologically oppressive laws of religious
tradition.
I believe that some discussion of
Deuteronomy 22:5 is called for at this point,
in order to help clarify the context of intent
of this particular Mosaic injunction. I have
found that, in attempting to discern meaning
and truth from Scriptural passages, it is
imperative to consider the chronological and
socio-cultural aspects_ofthe writing and of
the wrirer,s themst"l_ves.· Lr.t us eica,JT1ine fust
the actual verse that is Deuteronomy 22:5,
and then apply some additional information
in order to better understand the verse's
context, meaning, and intent.
Deuteronomy 22:5 says that "a
woman shall not wear anything that pertains
to a man, nor shall a man put on a woman's
garment; for whoever does these things is an
abomination to the Lord your God." Strong
words, these, and on the surface they appear
relatively concrete and indisputable.
However, let us take a closer look at what is
really being said and at what is implied by
this verse. Initially, I find it interesting that

......

women are ordered not to wear anything that
pertains to a man. If one talces this verse
literally, then women should never wear
pants or trousers of any kind. Many good
Christian women w..9ulcf. I am sure, be
discomfited to learn that their apparel is an
"abomination".
Fortunately for everyone concerned.
particularly crossdressers, Biblical scholar
David F. Payne's commentary on the Book of
Deuteronomy teUs us that "there is good
reason to suppose that the law of verse 5 is
not concerned with the mild sexual aberration
kQowr1· as tra.,svestism ", inifil a i-epuu.iatfon
of certain pagan religious practices of that
era; so this law is no more a fashion guide
for today than is the law about tassels in
verse 12. These tassels, whatever their
origin. were intended as a visible reminder to
every Israelite of his duty to obey God's laws
(cf. Numbers 15:37-41). In effect, they made
Israelites distinctive in their dress." 1
Payne goes on to say that "the
distinctive characteristics of a Christian
should be internal rather than external. There
is something wrong, however, if such inward
characteristics are not visible to other
9
people. " It would appear, based on Payne's
studied observations, that the behavior of
crossdressing is condemned only when done
as an adjunct to paganistic activity, I feel it
safe to assert that crossdressing for
emotional, psychological, or Christ-centered
spiritual reasons cannot and should not be
co11sic!�rffl. e.n "at-o."::ri.at�!!". M<'tiv�!io!!,
rather than the actual behavior itself, seems
to be the �tigating factor in this particular
equation.
Further substance is added to this ·
viewpoint by the Concordia Self-Study
Author's note: Despite the unfortunate choice
of terminology, i.e., "mild sexual aberration"
and "transvestism", keep the overall message
that Payne presents uppermost in your thoughts
at this point

Commentary, which tells us that the reason
for the Deuteronomy warning against
"wearing apparel of the opposite sex was ...
because it was the vogue among Canaanite
fertility worshippers." 10 Apparently the
Canaanites had a unique sense of fashion but
were lacking theological accuracy and
propriety. At any rate, since almost none of
us are'Canaanite fertility worshipers today, it
should seem rather obvious to any reasonable
person that this Scriptural passage is
concerned with faithfulness and obedience to
God rather than one's choice of clothing. It is
my opinion that God is overwhelmingly
interested in the condition of our hearts,
minds, and souls rather than what we wear
on the outside of our bodies. The Bible itself
corroborates that opinion, because I Samuel
16:7 says that "Man looks at the outward
appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."
Deuteronomy 22:5, �we said
earlier, is often quoted as an argument
against crossdressing. My response to this
argument is that, since the passage is part of
the Old Testament Law (from which Jesus
came to free us), and since no one but
Orthodox Jews still endeavor to follow all
these laws, why should the Christian Church
selectively pick out this particular passage to
enforce against those of us who crossdress?
Do Christians eat pork or seafood? Those
foods are forbidden by the law, but I do not
see many Christians following that particular
Levitical tenet. Do Christians keep kosher?

part of the law. Do Christians wear-clothing
made of various fibers (cotton and .flax,
etc.)? Of course they do - but this is also
forbidden in the law. The point is this:
crossdressers are often made scapegoats
through the selective enforcement of the Old
Testament laws, while other injunctions are
conveniently bypassed and/or ignored
completely by those who would use the law
as their tool of oppression. I feel that is

behooves those who would oppress
crossdressers solely on the basis of
Deuteronomy 22 : 5 to closely monitor their
own behavior in order to detennine whether it
is in complete compliance with the law. If it
is not, then I suggest that perhaps their
application of the law is hardly consistent
and thus somewhat suspect.
At this juncture, I believe it is
necessary to briefly address the concepts of
crossdressing as pleasure and the Church's
traditional view of pleasure as sin. The
institutionalized Church generally condemns
crossdressing because it vi�ws this activity as
a sexual perversion of some sort (despite the
fact that crossdressing is technically a form
of gender, not sexual, expression). The vast
majority of crossdressers begin their
crossdressing behavior in their early years,
and the activity usually becomes somewhat

intertwined with their new-found and highly
active erotic feelings and emotions (most of
us have gone through puberty, and I'm sure
we can relate to this concept of grappling
with eroticism, at least to some extent). It is
the pleasure associa!ed with these erotic
feelings that serves as a "hook" into the
psyche so that this pleasure becomes an
aspect of the crossdresser's sexuality and ·
personality.
JoAnn Roberts, Ph.D., a leader in
the transgender community, has said that
"Crossdressing has nothing to do with my
sexual orientation, and everything to do with
. my se:ma!ity. II She has. ?lso �;rl th:tt, if
crossdressing was not a stimu�ati.qg and , ·
rewarding experience, a crossdresser would
never continue with the behaviqr. The
question thus becomes: How does one deal
with being both spiritual and sexual,
particularly in the light of crossdressing
behavior? The answer is, I believe, found in
the transcendent mystery of life that God
offers to us as human beings. We are sexual
creatures, unique in our status as persons
made in the image of God. If we can accept
the idea that God has created us specifically
in and for uniqueness (and since there is no
one else in this world quite like you or like

me, I believe this concept to be valid), then it
becomes a relatively simple matter to further
accept the idea that we can not only be
sexual, but that we are to embrace and
celebrate this aspect of our humanity in
concert with our spirituality. This is not
always an easy thing to achieve, particularly
in the light of our sex-negative culture, but it
is certainly a goal worth striving toward.
It should be noted, as well, that
crossdressing often becomes a source of deep
emotional fulfillment and great reward that
can, and often does, move far beyond a
sexual motivatioil, especially as the
crossdresser ages . This change in
motivational emphasis can enable a
crossdresser to experience other, more
varied, aspects of the gender shift such as
personality development, spiritual growth,
philosophical and ideolo�ical changes in life

perspectives, etc. I view this as a healthy
thing, and would urge the Church to accept,
respect, and love any person who is making
the attempt to improve her/himself in this
manner.
Traditionally, Christians who
crossdress have read Deuteronomy 22:5 and
have often experienced great distress and real
spiritual agony as a result. I personally, dealt
with such trauma for many years as I
struggled with the theological implications
and the resulting inner turmoil concerning
this aspect of my life. Finally, however, I
began to comprehend the truth and the reality
of my own persorui1 relationshi� to God and
learned of the wonderful freedom to be found
in such a relationship. Would that t,he Church
as an institution come to that same
realization, in order to end the confusion,
spiritual suffering, isolation, and alienation
felt by so many crossdressers.
Many of us know, all too well, about
the Church's usual response to the
crossdressing community. What can we, as
Christians who crossdress, do to help and
empower ourselves in the struggle we face?
The German philosopher Goethe
once said "There is nothing more frightening
than ignorance in action, " to which I add a

�--

wholehearted "Amen." The effects of
"ignorance in action" are a constant reminder
of the crossdresser's marginaliz.ed status in
society as a whole and within the Church as
a microcosm of that society and its
institutions, including the Church. but we are
indeed one of the most misunderstood,
ostracized, and stigmatized groups. We need
to do something to counterbalance the
oppression, and I believe the answer is
twofold:
• First, we must actively seek •
God's face in prayer fo_r ou�. UY.��. and the
direction and purpose of those lives as we
struggle with the complexities of our spiritual
issues in the context of our Christianity.
• Second, and of equal importance
in the struggle, we must do everything in our
power to educate our sisters and brothers in
the Church about issues of sex and gender as
they pertain to our marginalized status with
the Body of Christ. Knowledge of a thing
creates stability and lessens anxiety, while
ignorance generates fear, bigotry, and
prejudice. It is my earnest and heartfelt desire
to see the Church become more
knowledgeable concerning matters that
pertain to crossdressers and our struggles .for
self-esteem and acceptance within our culture
and its institutions. I might suggest that you
give a copy of this book. anonymously if
necessary, to your pastor or other Church
leaders as a method of providing information
on this issue. Your efforts may be _rejec�:I �r
ignored. However, Goq's Holy· Spirit may
begin to move in someone's heart and mind
so that they are able to begin learning about
respect and acceptance for crossdressers as
viable, capable members of the Church. I
pray that will be the result in manv cases.

Do not let the con sci ous nes
s of your
unworthiness keep you from
believing
what God has said concernin
g you . If
you are a believer in the Lord Jes
us
then the precious privilege of bein
g
partnership with the Father and

Son is yours.
