Some Thoughts _on Telling Children About Crossdressing
by Paula Jordan Sinclair
of the Renaissance Education Association

Lee, your unfortunate experience with three of your children after the
airing of the .. Sally Jessy Raphael Show" in November confirms what I have
thought for some time: that there is an optimal time to tell children about
parental transvestism.
While it depends. to a great degree. on the
individuals concerned, a rnle of thumb can be developed.
There are those who advocate telling children at a very young age.
saying that young children have open minds uncontaminated with society's
false notions of two totally separate genders. B-Rfoctunately. children this
age also have · open mouths. and cannot be expected to keep a secret.
Putting this burden on them is both unfair and unwise.
There are those who say that teenagers can keep secrets (and often do
from their parents). so tell the kids when they are teens. This may not be
so good because the teen years are already full on conflict. While adolescent
boys are wondering about their own sexuality, teenagers of both sexes are
overly concerned about peer pressure. An additional complication for
teenagers is that they are trying to break away form their parents and
become individuals in their own right. A disclosure of transvestism my
cause that break to be more severe than necessary.
Adulthood, then, seems to be the logical time. right? Not necessarily.
By the time they reach adulthood, children have often developed an entire
mythology about their parents that guides their own lives ( .. I want to be just
like Dad/I won't make the mistakes Mom did when it comes to ...") A
sudden revelation that Dad (or Mom for that matter) isn't who they thought
they were could shake the child's confidence in who they are and where
they are going with their own lives. The result. dear Lee, can be rejection of
the parent who is the cause of the trauma: no parent, no trauma.
From my own experience. and from talking to other transvestites� I
believe that the best time to tell a child is just before the teenage years, say
ages 9 to 12 to give a rough approximation. Children at this age understand
the need for discretion (if it eXists for the family) and are surprisingly open
minded about such things.
I hasten to add that these are only guidelines, and apply only to
.. typical" children. Of-course no parent believes his or her child is typical,
so individual judgment . is best. But hopefully ._ihis will give transvestite
parents a framework on which to base their judgments about their own
children.

CHRISTIAN CIRCLES THAT ACTION IS KNOWN AS BEING "SAVED" WHILE IN OTHERS IT'S AN ACT OF SURRENOE�
TO Hrs LORDSHIP.
I

REGARDLESS OF WHAT TERPI IS USED THE SAL\/ATION OF OUR SOULS GOES FAR BEYOND THE CIRCUS-LIKE AT­
P�SPHERE OF AN "ALTAR CALL" ANO PEOPLE RUNNING DOWN THE CHURCH AISLE WITH THE CONGREGATION
SINGING "JUST As I A,1". NE)(T COPIES THE CALL FOR BACKSLIDERS TO RETURN TO Goo AT THE ALTAR. THAT
FAILING TO BRING ANYONE TO THE ALTAR THE CALL IS ISSUED TO "REDEDICATE YOUR LIFE TO THE LORD.
Amo ALL THAT HOOPLA POOR DAISY THE CROSSORESSER (CD) \'/HILE THE rORCES OF EVil, NAPIELY ThE DEVi L

SHE DOES NOT WANT TO BE AN ABOPIINATION SHE IS FORCED TO BRAND HERSELF A BAD SINNER. SINNER BE­
CAUSE OF CDING SHE rs NOT (SEND FOR THE ARTICLE, "ls Goo AGAINST Us" AND G&L #J FREE) AND SHE
HAS NOW DISQUALIFIED HERSELF FROPI BEING A CHILD OF Goo BECAUSE OF HER PURPORTED "ABOPIINATION".

ALTAR CALL FOR THE REDEDICATION OF HIS LIFE TO Goo. HE THOUGHT HE HAD GOTTEN AWAY FROPI Goo
AND IF HE'D REDEDICATE HIS LIFE EVERYTHING WOULD BE OK AND WINNIE WOULD GO AWAY. Nor so.
WILLIAPI,

PRECIOUS SUE AND AND DAISEY HAVE NOT RECOGNIZED THE FACT THEY ARE CD's THEY CAPIE OUT OF
THE WOPIB CD's. MR."HOLIER-THAN-THOU" IN ANY POSITION IN THE CHURCH FROPI PIEPIBER TO BISHOP HAS
BRANDED THEPI SINNERS AT A 1/ER!f· SINFUL GAPIE. WE CROSS-DRESS BECAUSE WE AR CROSSDRESSERS. CDING
IS NOT SOPIETHING WE DO FOR TEPIPORARY "KICKS" OR AS A VEHICLE TO SEXUAL ACTIVITIES OF WHICH,
PRAISE THE LORD, THERE ARE NONE FOR us� WE DO BECAUSE WE ARE AND WE ARE BECAUSE WE WERE BORN
THIS WAY!!!!(SEND FOR JAYE RE\/IERE's DEVOTIONAL PIECE ON THE ]39TH PsAut)
UNTIL WE CAN ACCEPT THE FACT WE ARE CDERS AND ACCEPT OURSELVES AS SUCH, IS JUST HOW LONG WE WILL
BE IN TURPIOIL. THE TURPIOIL EFFECTS us BOTH PHYSICALLY AND SPIRITUALLY. Goo LOVES YOU HAS BECDrlE

CONFLICTS : Crossdressing and Faith.
. Many of us are m an:i e ? . �fany of us seek to insure the ph ysical, spiritual, and emotional well-being of the
wives we love . . ½1 part, this 1s_ n�ht and p�oper. Ther� are, howeve r, limits beyond which it is inappropr iate to go.
_
There are cond.iuons when 1t is U1appropnate for us m our human essence to be in the "insurance" business in so
far as our spouses are concerned. Among these instances is the relationship between our spouse and the Lord.
Another is in the relationship our spouse has with herself.
Recently a long time frie nd wrote in obvious pain, how she has become convinced she cannot have a
satisfactory relationship with her spouse unless she turns her back on her feminine self and returns to the way she
was before she allowed the long buried parts of herself to emerge. This friendship goes back a number of years.
Discussions of this topic and discussions of her Faith-Walk have been central to our friendship. Her recent epistle
deeply conce.ned me .
It could be. as she says. the Lord has another path she ' s not tried. I believe this to be true. Central in this
belief is a deep conviction the Lord steers a steady course and does not change course along the way. There are
some further considerations too.
The Holy Will of God is two-fold. In some things, God's will is directive . God willed all creation into
existance. God made us as we are made according to God's directive Will and in accordance with God's Master
Plan. Being made as we are made. we have a place in the Master Plan of God. Being made as we are made we are
equipped perfectly to fulfill the role in the Master Plan for which we were made as we are made. God's will is
also permissive. It is herein, things get off track. We were also given free will. We are given free will to reject and
to rebel, but not to will ourslves into submission to God's Master Plan for us. In God's permissive will we are
taught only what we need to know of the Master Plan at the moment of our being taught It is up to us then to
submit to God's Master Plan for us and to walk the Faith-Walk trusting God to reveal even more to us as we go
along. If we submit to God's Master Plan for us and step out into the unknown, the fearful unknown, in the
Faith-Wal.le, then we arc blessed. More and more is revealed to us as we grow in Faith and gain experience in
walking the Faith-Walk. If we refuse to submit to God's Master Plan for us and insist on going our own way, we
face confusion and arc endlessly confounded in one way or another. We set forth, not in Faith, but on the basis of
assumptions we make.
There arc many fundamental reasons rejecting the Master Plan of God for our lives and turning our back on
the fundamental clements of the total person God created us to be simply will not work. First to do this. we have
to ignore all of the discussion in the paragraph above and have to impose our will in the place of God' s will.
Invariably we suffer the consequences when we do this. When we attempt to purge ourselves of this feminine
component the Lord made into us. when we attempt what is callt:d simply a "purge" so we can live according to
the unsound stereotype society sets. we arc actually attempting a form of spiritual suicide. We are attempting to
kill off part of the very person God created us to be. This is nothing short of self- murder in the emotional and
spiritual aspects of our humanity.
When we attcpt to do this St'lf-murder so our wives won' t feel adverse feclsings as a result of our discovery
of who, what, and how we were created to be. then we arc making some serious mistakes. We arc completely
wrong headed if we try to assume responsibility for the fe elin gs of ano ther person, wife or otherwise. If we
convince ourselves we have to purge so our wives won ' t be hurt. then we arc assuming responsibility for their
feelings, which is a total violatio n of their right to be indivi duals and their ri ght to be responsible for their own
feelings. We rob them of these rights when we begin to "caretake" their emoti ons. When we caretake the feelings
of another. we assume responsibility for what we cannot rightly be responsibl e. We deny others the right to feel as
they feel honestly. We · make all feeling aspects of our relationship with the person into a game of control and
dishonest interactions. When we refuse another person the right to feel as th e y feel, we are denying them their
humanity. Not only is it wrong to assume responsibility for the feelings of another, it is impossible for we cannot
control the feelings of another. If we persist in doing this, we will destroy the fundamental foundation of the
relationship and we will destroy both ourselves and the one we arc carctaking, in terms of feelings. When we
deny freedom to another to feel as they feel we arc denying them human digni ty and arc attempting to control them
for our own ends. In doing this we actually m ake a martyr of ourselves and end up with an ever growning sense
of resentment and passive-agressiveness toward the person we are carctakin g . Th.is is one of the fundamental
clements in the disease of codependency.

'f
I believe the Lor d has in store for each o f us many rich
believ e we are made as we are made to be special blessings to b lessings when we finally get pas t Kinde rgarte n. I
sharin g, fo r wisdo m, and for love. I bel ieve we have to get others the Lord wants to bring to us for training, fo r
ourselve s and our excee dingly hard heads out of
the
decisi on makin g loop and do what S tep 1 of the 1 2 steps
of HCDA (Hete rosexu al Cross dresse rs Anon ym ous)
says. Indee d we have to ackno wledge we are powerless over
crossd ressing as a manifestation of who, what, and
how we are by our fundam ental nature and so long as we work
agains t integra tion of our total selves into the full
measure of our human ity, our lives are indeed out of contro l. I b e li
e ve we have to trus t the Lord to work
His will
in our spous es. I believe we have to quit caretakin g their feeling s.
Titis does not mean being insens itive m acho
clods. It means being hones t with oursel ves and with our spouses. I belie ve we have
to trust our spous es to act
respon sibly. I believe we have to quit manip ulatively contro lling our
spous
es.
In
so
far
as our relatio nshi ps are
involv ing keepin g s,e c re ts . repres sing fundam ental parts of our
selves , and caretaki ng th e fe e lings of our spouses,
we are involved in grossl y dishon e:;t relatio nships . These n e ed to be
chan ged.
When we find oursel ves in such situations we need to be involved
with CODA (Code pende n ts Anonym ous)
to work out our feelin gs and to learn how to be hones t with oursel ves
and with those we love . We also need to be
involved with HCDA (Heterosexual Crossd ressers Anony mous)
so we can work out neede d accom odation s and
integra te the fullnes s of our being as God created us to be into our mania
ges. into our lives.
