The New Creation
by Norman Grubb

I know that nothing good lives in me -Romans 7:18
ISTAKENLY, WE OTTEN seem to think that God put Ada111 in the
Garden to test him, to see whether he would obey' or not. Not so.
It was because by no other means could Adam discover his own

innate helplessness.
It was not, as we often erroneously think, that Adam could have done the
good deed of rejecting the advances of Satan. If that were so, man could be
good by his own unaided effort. No, he was placed between those two trees
to learn that of himself he can do nothing good, and that he is not expected
to!
He was put into the Garden to was to learn the basic fact of his creation,
that his own human spirit is an empty, helpless vessel so far as living the good
life is concerned. "In me, that is in my flesh [my humanity] dwells no good
thing."
Man was not created to be good. He was created to be indwelt by the Good
One. The negative command not to eat of the tree, followed by the direct
terrlptation to do so, was not to stir into action some potential capacity iri
Adam for obedience and goodness, nor to demonstrate that he could be good
if he would. It was to reveal to Adam the one essential point he had to learn
about himself-that he was created helpless so far as being and doing good
is concerned.
Adam was to learn that his little human spirit had one marvelous poten­
tiality: his spirit could be the container of the Divine Spirit via the Tree of Life,
and yet he would not lose his own individuality. The glorious fact is that the
two-human and Divine-can dwell together, each in the other, in an eternal
fruitful bond of union.

SELF DISCOVERY
by Rebecca (Becky) Allison. M.D.
This is the fifth isue of G&L Letter to
which I have contributed. It will be my
most intensely personal article. even
more so than my first article. "Answered
Prayers." which was reprinted in Femme
Mirror. The personal revelations are
appropriate. even necessary. in view of
the changes which have occurred in my
life over the last two years.
Perhaps you long time readers have
noticed a slight change in the focus of
this publication. In the past. it was
sent as a letter to Christian
crossdressers; but the most recent
issues have been directed. as on our
front page. to our entire community, or
as L e e w o u l d abbreviate it.
"CD/TG/TS"'.
Why the change? Because in the
past. Lee and Jaye have had no back­
ground to relate to transsexuals. They
had the "CD/TG" covered quite well; but
they didn't have a writer who could
speak to the particular spiritual
concerns of the transsexual.
Now they have one.
I want to share with you the events
which led to my acceptance of my
transsexualism.
Next to my own
personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
this acceptance is the most basic and
profound experience of my life. It has
caused the. reordering of all my life's
plans and priorities. Perhaps my story
v:ill encourage and strengthen others in
the same position.
I have known from earliest
memories: I don't flt in. I was never
"one of the guys". As I remarked in
group therapy. "I feel as though my
whole life has been an out-of-body
experience." And from my teen years. I
have been aware of the reason for my
difference. And I was frightened.
because I could imagine even then the
enormous life changes which would re­
sult from admitting transsexualism. I
simply wasn't prepared to make such
fundamental changes.
So when I read in the medical school
library the statement -- I believe it was

in Benjamin's text -- "anyone who has
had a sexual experience as a male
cannot be transsexual." I was almost re­
lieved. "So I am a crossdresser." I
thought. "and I can experience this part
of myself and retain a 'normal' life." I
didn't realize Benjamin's statement was
totally erroneous.
For two decades I persuaded myself.
"I can crossdress once or twice a year at
out of town conventions." I married. fa­
thered a son. and became well estab­
lished in my profession.
And I was miserable. I changed
practice locations half a dozen times.
looking for peace and fulfillment.
As I related in "Answered Prayers". I
experienced great inner turmoil and
prayed for deliverance from my trans­
gendered nature. I could never under­
stand how God would let me remain in
such a dilemma. Finally He gave me a
reassurance of His love for me as He
created me. As I studied scriptures. I
realized the verses quoted to condemn
transgendered persons did not relate at
all to our situations: they have been re­
placed by Jesus's new covenant of love.
So I found some peace and self
acceptance� But I remained nervous
and unhappy over my family situation.
And with good reason: when I finally
shared my story with my spouse. it was
met with as much resistance as I had
feared. The subsequent months were a
tedious drama, in which it seemed every
scene had to be played in sequence.
until the inevitable separation. Only
now that we know we will have separate
lives can we finally speak as friends.
The drive toward fuller acceptance of
my true self intensified. Like a hyper­
bolic curve. it increased slowly. almost
imperceptibly at first. but accelerated
and reached an "elbow'' where the slope
rose like a rocket. My whole life. waking
and sleeping. revolved around Becky.
In seeking out others like. myself. I
met Lee Frances. Surely it was God's
direction. not coincidence. that brought

.

together two transgendered Christians
living within five miles of each other.
The more I talked with others in the
gender community. hearing their life
sto ries. I became aware of distinct
differences in the pattern of their lives.
Many were secure in their identity as
men with a strong feminine side. finding
expression of their personality with
temporary assumption of a woman's
appearance. And they were happy to
return to their male persona afterwards.
Was I supposed to feel that way?
But I didn't. Evezy few hours of feminine
expression intensified the need for
more. I never wanted to give it up.
Others had a different pattern. They
told me of years of frustration. dissatis­
faction. and depression before finally
finding peace. I listened to them and
thought of the old Roberta Flack song,
"Telling My Whole Life With Your
Words." Because they were describing
my life exactly.
And. of course. these persons were
transsexual.
With fascination and fear I realized:
I don't want to look like a woman part of
the time. I want to -- I must -- BE a
woman forever. as I feel I already am.
And yes. that means I do not want to be
a man. Never again.
Such thoughts needed a long time
for consideration before I could act on
them. I did not want to fall into "sec­
ondary transsexualism" by mistake.
But over months of thought. prayer.
and therapy. I came to understand: This
is nothing new. This is who I always
have been. When viewed in this
context, my whole life makes sense.
But what implications did this new
understanding have for my spiritual
life? I had gone through such a struggle
to be confident that God accepted me
and loved me as a crossdresser: did I
have to start over and reconcile my
transsexualism with my Chrtstlanity?
The verses usually quoted with re­
gard to crossdressing (Deuteronomy
22:5 and I Corinthians 6:9) might be
used in reference to transsexualism
only by someone with no understanding
of the situation. Neither I . nor any
other transsexual person with whom I
have spoken. consider ourselves a "man
in a woman's garment" or "effeminate".

I am not a man. I am a woman
behaving appropriately for my gender.
How do I know I am a woman? I
have the anatomy of a man. But just as
surely as I know my anatomy. I know
my soul -- my spirit. And I have the
soul of a woman. I did not arrive at this
knowledge hastily. It comes from hours
of study, prayerful meditation. and
And I know I have the
prayer.
assurance of the Holy Spirit and the
peace that passes all understanding.
And what of the argument. "You
should not alter the body God gave
you"? Does this apply to cleft palates.
congenital heart disease. or even big
noses? Who believes !t is a sin to
correct a ventricular septal defect? And
so what is the difference with an
unwanted part of the anatomy? Why
can we not view our anatomy as a birth
defect? In my opinion it is exactly that.
The part of me which is eternal is
my spirit, not my body. The body ls
temporal and so. if my eternal spirit and
my mortal body are in irreconcilable
conflict. I may alter my body to resolve
the conflict.
In summazy. I can find no scriptural
reference to transsexualism. I must rely
on the guidance of the Holy Spirit to
show me God's will in such a
circumstance. He has done so, and I
know His peace.
And so I have joyfully accepted my
womanhood. even with the implications
for total change in evezy relationship in
my life. My marrtage ts gone: my career
will survive, but I will start over one
more time. And I have never been more
excited about life. In less than one year.
I hope ·to be living and working full time
as Dr. Rebecca Allison.
And I hope. in subsequent issues of
this letter, to keep you aware of God's
working in my life as I continue this
greatest adventure Imaginable. I pray
you will be touched and blessed also.
l would love to hear from you with
regard to your spiritual journey. Give
me your. suggestions on future topics
regarding transsexualism and spiritual
issues. All will be considered.

WHY ME , LORD?
H a s t h is been you r c ry to o u r
Lord? "Why did this have t o happen to
me?" ''I have prayed and prayed . Lord .
for this affliction to be removed from
me. Why must I dress and act in the
man ner of t he female gender? Yet I feel
so nat u ral and com posed when I' m in
the fe m m e mode: it' s almost as if I
shou ld have been a woman . but I know
you make no mistakes. I as ked yo u to
remove the tobacco habit from me. You
d id . I as ked yo u to re move alcohol
abuse from my life. You did . Again my
cry was for you to remove the addictive
use of prescrt ption drugs from my life.
Yo u did . Then I as ked yo u to remove
t h i s a d d iction I h ave to wo m e n ' s
clothes . At least I think it's a n addic ­
tion . S ociety looks on it as disgusting,
shameful, repulsive: not to say what my
wife thinks of it. And if I am ever dis­
covere d , my marriage [or relations h i p !
and job are in jeopardy. I could n't face
it all . " Yo u have prayed and prayed.
and in some cases lit candles in church
asking for deliverance. All to no avail.
I f you have prayed this way. take
heart in what the Lord told S t. Pa u l
when he as ked three times for the Lord
to remove the thorn in his flesh given to
him to keep him from becoming too
conceited. "My grace ls s u fficient for
yo u . . . My powe r is made perfect i n
weakness . " ( 2 C ori nth ians 1 2 :9 ) We
don ' t know why we were chosen to be
C Ds or why • we were made this way.
You r thinking may go : "Well. St. Pau l's
conceit is not immoral llke CDin� is . "
WHAT! ! Immoral?
How d are you ! !
C rossdressing is like everything else. In
itself it is not immoral u ntil it is put to
immoral use. I am talking a bo u t the
innocuous aspect of crossd ressing. We
are normal heterosexual males who
have a pronounced feminine side in our
psyche ( soul. mind ) which demands ex­
pression in our imitating wome n. give n
the opportunity.
O u r daily lives are no different
from any other res ponsible male . We
are scientists and janitors and every­
thing in between. with no distinguishing
marks to betray or stat u s as C Ds
( u nless yo u ru n into the office for a
mome n t after c h a nging i n t o m e n ' s

clothes. havt ng forgotte n to re move lip­
stick and earrtngs! My p lace of part­
time employment knows I am a C D and
my big boss doesn't care what I wear as
long as I ge nerate sale s . My immediate
s u pe rvisor can't handle CDing, so I ac ­
quiesce to her good pleas u re and t h u s
keep peace in the family. ) I see n o im­
morality in our brand of CDing . It is a
"thorn" in that we have to conceal it and
worry a bo u t discovery . This kind o f
weakness c an be made into a strength.
I used to pray for deliverance us­
ing all of those c hoice adjectives as I
prayed, telling God that my C D ''habit "
was a vile , repu lsive. disgusting habit.
The tru th is , I didn't feel that way at all.
but God said in De ute ronomy 2 2 : B . I
was an abomination to him . I couldn't
let him k now how m u c h I e njoyed it.
The laughable thing ls, I was trying to
"con" God by s peaking to him in terms .I
felt would tickle his ear. He knew those
were baseless , empty prayers , as I en­
joyed C Dlng and God KNEW I did . It
was later I learned he made me this
way. I came out of the wom b a CD be­
cause he "created my inmost being and
knit me together in my mother' s womb . "
( Psalm 1 29 : 1 3 ) . I n asking fo r dellver­
ance we are asking t hat God's divine
plan for ou r Hves be breached. We may
as well pray for the color of our eyes to
be changed to our choice of color. [ Pink
and blue are my favorite colors , in that
order. One of the nicest things about
coming out of the closet in 1 989 was I
co u ld wear my pink s u it with a bandon!
The sun could shine on it and intensify
its beauty. I am satis fied with my bl ue
eyes , so I thank God for my pink suit
and blue eyes. ]
G od has said . "My grace ls suffi ­
cient for you. for my strength is made
perfect in weakness . If you want to la ­
bel C Ding as a weakness (as I did for my
entire adult life until 1 989 ) then it is a
weakness and you're stuck with it. O n
the other hand. when you finally acce pt

( Psalm 1 39 : 1 4 ) .
C hristian transsexuals : God bless
you. You eith�r will give. or have already

a "makeover" via sexual reassignment
s u rgery. Don ' t stop there . Be all yo ll

blood to pay for the sins of mankind. of
which all are included . Let him give you
a spiritual makeover. and then you are
complete in him.
So. my dear sisters , let's lay aside

middle of the room and praise and
thank God for the way h e made u s .

Advisory

It is our position that the psychological and
social effects wbicb occur as a result of preparing
for and beginning a period offull-time cross-living
are in mos t ca ses po tentia lly far more disruptive
than the lingering effects or physical dangers of a
short period on hormones. We believe that requiring
a ma n da t o ry p e riod of rea l-life tes t b efo re
initiation of hormonal therapy can be and oftm i s
bam1fui, a nd should no t be a universal requirement
o r e ven tbe us ual rule. Wh ile we agree that the
individu a l s oo u ld ha ve experience in tbe new
gender role, we urge practitioners and clinics wbo
adhere to tbts p racttce of glo b al requirement of
full-time cro. �1/iving before hormor.ei t:, change it. 1. z

ON GENDER DYSPHORIA
AND THE CHURCH
by Terri Main
NOTE : Terri Main is a new woman
(J u ly 1 993 ) who has writte n extensive ly
on transsexualism and spiritu al iss ues.
Her essays on the C ompuserve b u lletin
board system have been a great blessing
to many transsexu al person s . myse lf
included . The following selections from
''On Gender Dys phoria and the C hu rch"
are re p ri nted by permission from her
Com puserve li brary. -- RA
Tal king a bo u t TH E C H U R C H ts
s o rt o f l i k e t a l k i n g a b o u t T H E
COMPUTER or THE TREE or THE BIRD .
Eac h denomination i s different. In fact ,
each local congregation is different. So.
maybe I should clarify the pers pective
from which this essay is written . I am
writing from the point of view of ortho­
dox . fu n damental C hristian ity. I am
writing as one who believes the Bible to
be the revealed Word of God , who be­
lieves that C hrist was the Son of God in
su bstance as well as s pirit. who believes
that C hrist's death on the cross acted as
an atonement for the sins of the world .
who believes in a perso nal God . a pe r­
sonal salvation . and a personal relation ­
ship with God through Christ. Much of
what is said in this piece wou ld apply to
any mainstream denomination . inclu d ­
ing both Protestant and Catholic .
I remem be r growin g u p in the
ch urc h. I was born on S unday and was
in chu rch Wednesday evening. I've gone
ever since. My parents and grandpar ­
ents were active in the church. but mine
was no second hand experience . I per­
sonally prayed and read my Bi ble. I
personally experienced the presence of
God i n my life. Arou nd our house . God
was no philosophical construct: he was
an o bj ective reality like another member
of the family. As a child and teenager, I
had one major prayer: "Lord . please ei ­
ther make me a gtrl . or make me like
othe r boys. " The Lord in His wisdom
did neither. I didn't see any conflict be ­
tween being a transsexual and being a
C hristian . I still don't . bu t now I know
there are others who do.

What is the source of this feeling?
T h e a n s we r i s s i m p l e : i g n o ra n c e .
Ignorance o f the nature o f transsexual­
ism and ignorance of scriptu re combine
to cau se many well meaning C hristian
people to brand transsexu alism as a
sin.
Now, before condemning the ac ­
tions of C hristians wJ-io voc iferously op­
pose trans sexualis m . re me m be r t hat
their motives are noble. even if their ac­
tions are not. If I believe that vou are
doing something that will cau se· eternal
harm to you . I have a moral obllgation
to tiy to save you from that harm. The
best analogy ls that of a person wander ­
ing out into a street and not seeing a
car racing toward them . A bystander
wou ld have a moral obligation to warn
t h at person that a car was comi n g .
S uc h is t h e motivation of the C hristian
warning a person away from sin.
So the pro blem is not usually mo­
tivatio n . b u t rat h er u nd e rsta nd i n g .
How do people o ft e n mis u nderstand
transsexualism?
I think the name transsexualism is
what throws a lot of people off. Th ey
seem to take the "sex" part as referring
to the sex act ( an act many of u s on
hormones would find difficult to perform
anyway) rather than to gender. I prefer
to talk about ge nder dys phorla.
It
sou nds more clinical. and it is more ac­
curate. It usually won 't lead people to
misu nderstand the sexu al connotations
of the condition.
People who condemn transsexual­
ism as a s i n not only are ignoran t of
gender issues. they are also ignorant of
the Bible on this s u bject . This area
simp ly is not covered in scripture one
way or another. It falls into the cate ­
gory of "working out you r own salvation
with fear and trembling. "
Two scriptu res which some point
to as condemning transsexualism are
De u teronomy 2 2 : 5 an d I Corin thians
6 : 9 . In the first, "wearing apparel per­
taining to a woman " is condemned . I
might add, in the next verse so is taking
a mother bird away with her brood ;
bu ilding a house without a parapet: and

sowi ng a vineyard wit h two d i ffe rent
kinds of seed s . I n u nderstanding this
sc ri pt u re. we must look at the c u l t u ral
setti ng. In many idolatro u s p ractices .
great orgies wou ld be held i n which men
and women wo u ld crossd ress for the
pu rpose of sexual arousal and ritualistic
indiscriminate sex. S u c h bacchanals
often ended with some men castrating
t h e m s e l ves an d be c o m i n g e u n u c h
priests t o pagan goddesses . From the
transsexual's point of view. we are not
me n wearing d resses: we are wome n - ­
i n training before SRS - - i n body afte r ­
ward . I n fact. it i s most a ppropriate
that we d ress as women . since it is
proper for wome n tu wear wo rne n ' s
clothing! I might add that t h is i s the
only scri pture in the entire Bible dealing
with cross d ressing at all. It is poor
hermane u tics ( script u ral analysis ) to
build an entire doctrine from a s ingle
ve rs e . es pec ially a ve rse from Old
Testament law most of wh ich h as bee n
s u perseded by the grace o f the new
covenant in Christ.
The second scripture lists a series
of types of sin ners who are not to in herit God's kingdom. In the King James
ve rsion t h is reads : "Be not deceived :
neither fornicators . nor idolaters . nor
nor
ad u ltere rs . nor E F F E M I NAT E .
abusers of themselves With mank i n d .
n o r thieves . n o r covetou s . n o r dru n k­
ards . nor revilers . nor extortioners . shall
in herit the ki ngdom of God . And such
were some of you : bu t you are was hed .
you are sanctified . you are J ustified in
the name of the Lord Jesu s and by the
S pirit of God . " ( I Cor. 6 : 9- 1 1 ) T he word .
"effe minate " . is the word which ca uses
some people problems. However. it is a
mistrans latio n . It is better translated
"C atamite " . Catamites in G reek cu l­
t u res were pros titutes . B u t the word
also a pplied to those who p u rchased
their services as · well as those who
managed their ca reers . Most modern
translations [are ! more accurate .
S o . if it is not s pecifically con­
dem ned by Scri pt u re . how then can
transsexu alism be viewed? I n my opin­
ion . I believe it can be viewed in m uc h
t h e same manner we would view a birth
defect. If there is a defect which can be
c u re d by s u rgery . most C h rist ian s
wo u ld applau d t he medical comm u n ity
as an agent of heali ng. They wou ld not

say. "That' s the way God made you . you
should stay as you are " to the person
with a c l u b foot . with a cleft palate . or
eve n with a crooked nose . big ears . o r
other facial features which cou ld b e cor­
rected by s u rgery. . Why should n ot the
same be said to the transsexual who
simply wis hes to live a normal life as a
woman? Not a perverted life : j u st a
sim ple. and in the case of the Christian
transsexual. a virtuous life as a woman .
T h e re ts o n e other ga u ge t h e
C h ristian has t o j u dge an action . That
gauge is the peace of God . At salvation .
the Holy S pirit pu ts a type of spiritual
barometer inside. It quickens the spirit
when an action is considered whic h is
wrong. From pe rsonal experie nce. I
have the peace of God abo u t what is
happening. I don' t always u nderstand
what is happe ning. but God gives !Ile
his as s u rance that he has everything
u nder control. His presence holds me
firm when the painfu l episodes come .
Without his presence and peace. I' m not
s u re what I wou ld have done a few years
ago. I might not even be here writing
this essay.
About n i ne months ago. I was
crossliving part time. attending c h u rch
alternately as a male and as a female
( different c h u rches ) . I was wondering
whether I might have been mistaken . so
I set forth a test for myself. I prayed
and said . "Lord . I want to do what's
right. So. I won't set any rou tine for my
dressing. I will simply go by the u nction
of your spirit . As I feel. so will I dress. " I
have never felt t he leading of the spirit
to dress as a male ever agatn.
My transition so far has been
amaziugly smooth . I have seen literal
miracles of finance, timing. and circu m­
stances occur. In short. I have seen the
hand of God i n everyth i ng that has
happened so far. I believe God has a
p u r pose in this . Romans 8 : 2 8 says
''God works all things together for the
good of those who love him. and are the
called according to his p u rpose . " A
looser translation p u t it t his way: "God
is putting all the pieces of the puzzle to ­
gether. " To me that is exciting. In the
words of an old song of the c h u rc h . " I
d o n ' t k now about tomorrow. I don ' t
seem t o u nderstand . B u t I k now who
holds tomorrow .
He ' s t h e one who
holds my hand . "
