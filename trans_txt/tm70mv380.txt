Deuteronomy 22:5 to dogmatically state that women must never wear

22:5 refers specifically to CULTIC transvestism. Men dressed as
women, and vice versa, in worshipping heathen gods.

A morning prayer
Lord, in the quiet of this morning hour
I come to thee for wisdom, peace, power
To view the world through love-filled eyes,
Finding your image in every human guise.
Silence my tongue to all that is unkind;
Let only thoughts that bless be in mind.
Let me so kindly be, so full of cheer
That those I meet may feel thy presence near.
So clothe me in thy beauty, Lord, I pray,
That my life may reveal thee all this day.

THE GIFT GOES ON
By Rebecca Anne Allison
The Lord God has given me an instructed tongue,
To know the word that sustains the weary.
He wakens me morning by morning,
Wakens my ear to listen with understanding.
-- Isaiah 50: 4
How do you answer the "why" question? Even if no one has asked you why
crossdres
ou
�, the day will come when you must find answers for yourself.
r,
Why ask why? may be a good excuse to nave a beer, but it is inadequate as
an explanation for the uniqueness of our lives.
I will not list all the suggested.environmental and biologic causes for
tra�sgendered behavior. No s�ientific proof supports any of these suggestions.
Environmental causes are all inadequate. For any given suggestion, there are
too many "false negatives" (persons who are crossdressers but were never ex­
posed to the environmental factor) and "false positives" (persons who were
exposed to the factor but never became crossdressers).Furthermore, environ­
mental conditioning produces learned behavior patterns, and learned behavior
can be "unlearned" through techniques such as aversion therapy. Do you know
· of anyone cured by aversion therapy? I thought not.
A biologic explanation may yet be found through genetic research. The
difficulty here lies in the lack of any demonstrable inheritance pattern.
Dominant, recessive, X-linked, Y-linked, or variable penetrance patterns have
not been found. Perhaps other biologic, not necessarily genetic, causes will
be discovered. Such a biologic• cause would help to explain the marked simi­
larities in the life pattern of so many of us.
With this discovery, if it occurs, some of us may find our curiosity is
satisfied. A biologic cause -- very well. "I crossdress because I am a cross­
dresser." Enough said. I'm special; I'm one of the few four-leaf clovers in
the field. Even some of our community's leading writers will say, "Some
things just ARE," and be content.
I can't be content. I'm like the little child who drives Daddy to dis­
traction by asking "why?" to Daddy's repeated explanations of this world's
phenomena.
If there is a biologic cause for crossdressing -- why?? and why ME???
I am a Christian, as I discussed in my previous article, and I approach
lif€'s questions from a Christian viewpoint. If you disagree -- read on
anyway! It's unlikely you will be offended, and you may find some provocative
thoughts. Some of these thoughts were inspired by a marvelous article in
Tapestry 1152, "The Gift," by Janice Van Cleve.. For the many whose �eading
does not extend so far into the past, these points are worth repeating.
Our God is all powerful, the creator and sustainer of the universe; yet
he is also the creator and sustainer of each individual person, and his atti­
tude toward us is one of infinite love. "I have loved you with an everlasting
love; I have drawn you with loving kindness." (Jeremiah 31:3)
Out of love, God made each of us unique and gave us attributes which
differ greatly from person to person. My gifts are not identical to yours,
so by complementing one another, we can work efficiently for the common good.

- 2 Paul, in 1 Corinthians 12, likened the differing gifts to the functions of the
different body parts such as the hand, foot, eye, and ear.
WI:at gifts_do we me�n? The list begins in 1 Corinthians 12 with teaching,
preac�ing, he�li�g, helpin� others, and administrative abilities, among others.
Certainly artistic and musical talent are God's gifts, as are a keen intellect
and communication ability (Isaiah 50:4).
But the list of gifts goes far beyond special talents. Look at Paul's
description of his gift in 2 Corinthians 12:7: "To keep me from becoming con­
ceited.•. , there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to
torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But
he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect
in weakness." What is he saying? Paul's "thorn" was some sort of physical
defect which was a constant discomfort to him. The point. is, even though such
a defect might be seen as a torment from Satan, Paul regarded it as a gift
from God!
How can a good, loving God give his beloved child such a gift? This seems
to contradict Jesus's teaching in the Sermon on the Mount: "If you who are evil
know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in
heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!" (Matthew 7:11)
But as we look more closely, we gain insight into God's reasons for bestow­
ing these gifts: Every gift is given for a purpose. When a gift is used for
right purpose, everyone benefits: both the recipient of ·the gift and other
persons who are influenced by the recipient. Ultimately, the gift honors God
and brings the recipient into closer harmony with God. Our gifts are to be
used, not rejected or hidden. When we use our gifts, God will bless our ac­
tions in ways which may or may not be apparent to us.
Now we are finally ready to give an answer to the "why" question:
Why do we crossdress?
We crossdress because it is an integral part of our nature, created in
us by God. It is one of his good gifts to us, and is to be used for its
intended purpose.
It should be obvious that crossdressing is an integral part of our nature.
We did not choose it, no more than we chose to be brown eyed or right handed.
We cannot successfully reject it. Its basic and permanent quality is not difficult to acknowledge.
But is it God's gift to a few special persons -- or is it, as some would
have us believe, "a sinful perversion"? If it were sinful, many of us would
have experienced deliverance from it over the years. A great many sincere
prayers for such deliverance have been offered. The desire for feminine ex­
pression remains within us as intense as ever despite these prayers. As I
discussed in my last article, we can therefore conclude that crossdressing
is not sinful and is part of God's plan for our lives. God gives only good
gifts t·o his children. What joy and reassurance we gain from that knowledge!
So what should we do with our special gift? In the parable of the
. differing gifts (Luke 19:11-27) Jesus plainly stated we are .to make use of
our gifts, to be productive in the service of the Lord. We are not to hide
our gift or suppress it by denying its existence. This means that full self­
acceptance is not only possible, it is essential for our continued growth.

- 3 -

We can learn much from our gift. We can be especially sensitive to
women's concerns in our male dominated society. We can even work as our
male selves toward relieving injustices toward women, professionally and
personally, wherever they occur. Beyond gender inequity, we can overcome
all kinds of prejudice and discrimination in our own lives. We will be
sensitive to bigotry in any form.
In the religious realm, being transgendered is a dreadful state in the
view of many persons. Our gift enables us to see the hypocrisy evident in
those who would deny us access to God, while showing a rigid lack of compas­
sion or love for those they cannot understand. We will let our lives be
guided by love, and we will not be defeated by the condemnation of the
modern day Pharisee.
One of the most important uses of our gift is to help others who are
similarly gifted. ("To know the word that sustains the weary," Isaiah 50:4.)
So many, like me such a short time ago, need to hear the message: you are
not sick, you are not perverted, and you are not alone. We have no idea
how many lonely sisters still have not heard.
Can we go even farther? Can we use our gift to enlighten society -­
to destroy the rigid and artificial barriers of gender? Such an outcome
was forecast by Virginia Prince in "The Death of Gender" but it is still
a future hope. For now we depend on our boldest leaders to carry through
the media our message that we are also persons of worth and dignity. I
wonder if one day I too may find the freedom to say, "You have worked and
lived alongside me. You have seen my life and appreciate the results of
my efforts. Now know there is even more to my life. Understand these
traits that have shaped me into a �aring and sensitive friend. Learn from
me -- and never again feel the same way about us."
Is it too much to dream?
"With God, all things are possible. "(Mark 10:27)

Over the years we have developed the idea
that being present to people in all their needs is
our greatest and primary vocation. Toe Bible
does not seem to support this. Jesus· primary
concern was to be obedient to His Father. to live
constantly in His presence. Only then di� it
become clear to Him what His task was m His
relationships with people.

-Henri Nouwen

Before trading in your
q
p
old e ui ment go for a
test rive first.
You wouldn't buy an expensive car without looking under the hood, would you? Without starting the engine? Without
taking it out on the road? Without having it checked by a mechanic? Of course not. Well, neither should you rush into an
irreversible procedure like sex reassignment surgery without a period of at least one year in which you will work and live
24 hours a day in your chosen gender.
This period of crossliving (called the real-life test) is part of the Standards of Care of the Harry Benjamin International
Gender Oysphoria Association, and is required by all reputable surgeons and gender clinics, for it has been found that a
period of crossliving minimizes the chance of surgical regrets.
Sex reassignment surgery does not tum men into women, or women into men; it merely confirms what already is. Few
people see your genitalia. but your gender is evident to everyone. Rushing into surgery before establishing yourself in
your new role is taking a needless risk.
The period of crossliving is like a test drive. It enables you to establish yourself in your new role. to experience your new
life before making permanent changes to your body.
Think about it: would you rather pay for that new car before you take the test drive or after you have taken it around the
block?

SLAVERY? FREEDOM? FAITH?
by
Jaye Reviere, DD, Ph.D.

The clear blue Alaskan sky was
cold. The ''horn" had blown, jangling
nerv P.s and sending all o f us
scramblin g out of our cozy warm
quarters, into the Ford Station
wagons, painted Air Force Blue, which
with tires screaming, one after another
leapt from the back wall of a huge
hanger and roared through the
opening doors onto the aircraft
parking ramp. "Just another practice
alert", we thought. SAC bomber crews
on "Alert" knew well the soul searing
rasp of the klaxon horns, constantly
practiced and drilled in getting the big
fuel and thermonuclear loaded
bombers p arked outside off the
ground in less than the magic
(required) 15 minutes.
This time it was no "drill", not a
practice alert.. . in moments, radios
were cracklin g. . . each aircraft
c ommander was checking in,
reporting ready to start engines .... We
were p uzzled . . . in a practice, we
weren't told to hold off on engine
start... normal procedure was to start
t a x i i ng
b e gin
and
engines
immediately. This time we were told
to hold and not start ... to wait... to sit
with our finger poised literally over
the starter button.
From my perch, high above the
ground in the plexiglass cockpit of the
sleek jet bomber, I could see across the
whole airdrome. Fighter aircraft from
an air defense unit were taking off,
their afterburners blasting a deafening
roar. Far to the northeast, I- could see
the first of multiple convoys already
formed and beginning to pull out into
the hills, to deploy away from the
Anny post next to the base. Soon the
fighters all were gone .... blasting on a
column of noise and flames into the
cold Alaskan ·skies. We sat with
external power units running . . .
listening to the radios. . . panic was just
under the point of control in the voices
we were hearing.
We waited, for hours ... we waited.
We never did start engines. We didn't
taxi. We didn't take off. We'd wanted
to launch, in �e worst way... we knew
the "balloon" had gone up, and didn't
want to be caught on the ground by a
Soviet ICBM ... We waited.

Later we learned a U-2 Pilot had ! ong as I "stuffed " my femini ne
been shot down over the USSR. . . interests and denied myself th eir
Frances Gary Powers ... spy pilot... the expre ssion? How was I to know I
world hung within the bares t of could never know peace and could
the rmo n u c l e a r never know happiness so long as I sat

wanted to launch . . . we honestly supposed to be? How was I to know
wanted to get off the ground so we'd when I wasn't consulting the God I
have a chance to get in our "licks" professed to worship? How was I to
before our one way missions ended know when I was ignoring the only
our lives in flames somewhere over real authority capable of clearing the
the distant lands controlled by the issue, The Holy Spirit of God? Indeed,
Soviet Empire...
how was I to know?
We were committed . We had no
freedom in the matter. We did exactly
what we were told to do. We would
have done the unthinkable because
being prepared for and doing the
unthinkable was our job ... we were
slaves, in the truest sense of the word.
We are told in the Holy Word of
God a knowledge of the Truth will set
us free. We at the time considered
ourselves to be custodians of the
Truth. Whether or not we were is not
the issue in this writing. What is at
issue is the reality of Spiritual
Freedom which in deed is available
ONLY when one has accepted the
Truth offered to us by Jesus Christ,
who offers us what we cannot earn,
offers to give it to us as a free gift,
unmerited, unearned, and without
condition so long as we will accept
what is given on God's terms.
A career military officer, I found
the idea of being "sold out, given over,
surrendered" completely outside my
ability to consider. After the military,
while serving a local church as the
head elder, the pastor's pastor as it
were, I began to be confronted with
more than I was learning in gradua.te
school. I began to be confronted with
this urge for feminine expression
which I'd "stuffed" or kept totally
hidden from all others denying it even
to myself all these years.
Tragic events ente'red my life
bringing me emotionally to the point
of surrender. A surrender I could not
previously contemplate became my
only path to continued existence.
Surrender to what, you might ask.
Surrender to the God who made me to
be who, what, and how HE chose to
make me to be, not what I thought I
had to be because society said so ....
How was I to know inner peace
would be denied me continually as

The day, I don't remember when it
was ... just what it was, is burned in
my memory. My secreta ry had
scheduled no patients, I had time for
some "paper work". I found myself
standing in my office. I saw what
appeared to be random piles of
rubble . . broken bits and p ieces of
something, I knew not what. Then the
scene cleared a bit and I realized I was
looking at myself.... broken and tom
into bits and pieces . . scattered all
about. Then came the realization I was
being given a unique opportunity... an
opportunity to sort through the parts
of myself ... to discard the unworthy
p arts and to begin with God 's
guidance, to construct from the broken
pieces remaining, someone I could
love, someone I could respect,
someone I could hold in positive
regard ... someone God wanted me to
be.
We are told in the scripture of the
"rich young ruler" who when
confronted with giving up the thing
dearest to himself to follow Jesus, how
he'd declined, unwilling to take Christ
on face value and make Christ first in
his life... his earthly possessions
owned him. He didn't own them. He
was a slave to his material wealth.
Over the intervening years, the
rebuilding process which began so
long ago in an office now no longer in
service has moved progressively
onward. Each new day, it seems,
s o me t h i n g
new,
s o m e th i n g
meaningful i s revealed in just how
minutely the Lord cares for us and
will provide for us IF WE WILL GET
OURSELVES OUT OF THE WAY; if
we will LET GO, LET GOD!
When we let go and let God
handle the details of life ... when we
surrender . . . we then learn the Truth
which indeed does set us FREE. Only
-30when God is first are we FREE!

We meet God in the Bible
The literary and cultural significance of the Bible
is secondary. Indeed, it is almost incidental. The
purpose of the Bible is not literary pleasure and
cultural broadening, but food and insight for the
journey of life. The ghetto woman who spells out
the words as she reads is therefore closer to the
lifestream of the Bible than the university professor
who approaches the Book as simply part of our
cultural heritage. The Bible comes out of human
experience, and it is best understood there. It is
God's reach to our human souls, and it fulfills its
ultimate purpose when the human and the divine
meet in its reading.
-J. Ellsworth Kalas
